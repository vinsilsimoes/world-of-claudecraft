// The line-count RATCHET for the repo's known monolith files. Module-first is the
// doctrine (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity): new logic lands as its own sibling module
// behind an existing seam, and the coordinator files below must never GROW. Between
// v0.30.0 and v0.36.0 every sanctioned coordinator grew anyway and several new
// monoliths formed, so the doctrine gets a deterministic gate: each named file has a
// ceiling a little above its size when this gate landed. Exceeding the ceiling fails
// the suite.
//
// How to respond to a failure here:
// - The fix is EXTRACTION, not raising the ceiling: move the new logic into a sibling
//   module behind the file's seam (listed per row below; recipe in the
//   extract-and-test skill, .claude/skills/extract-and-test/) and import it.
// - After a real extraction shrinks a file, LOWER its ceiling to the new size plus a
//   small margin in the same change; the ratchet only works if it tightens.
// - Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision: do it only when a change genuinely
//   cannot land behind a seam, keep the raise small, and justify it in the PR body.
// - A missing file usually means it was split or renamed: update or remove its row in
//   the same change so the gate tracks the real tree.
//
// Data-as-code is exempt by design (src/sim/content/, the i18n catalogs and matcher
// DICTs, generated artifacts): those tables are correctly large. This gate names only
// LOGIC files.

    // LastKeepMapPainter declarations and the two walk-in map branches on the
    // clearMapHitState pattern), riding on main's zero-slack pin. Exact merged

    // Raised for the controller cross hotbar, on top of the moved-base v0.39
    // re-pin. The additions are thin-consumer wiring to an extracted domain
    // (src/ui/hud/cross_hotbar/): the overlay's construction, its per-frame paint,
    // and the one public seam the pad drives it through. Everything with substance
    // (the view, painter, resolvers, panel-hooks shape) lives in that domain, and
    // the earlier attempt to buy these lines by extracting UNRELATED pre-existing

    // with the Attack branch beside it: Attack is the fixed slot-0 toggle rather
    // than an ability, so it is the one action the seed cannot copy off the bar.
    // Raised for the cross-hotbar cast-fallback fix: the fallback grows an item

    // rearrange (the MobileHotbarDrag type, the field, clearMobileHotbarDrag,
    // bindMobileActionDrag, bindMobileRingDrag and the two point-to-slot hit
    // tests) is DELETED, and the overlay that replaces it lives in
    // hud/action_bar/bar_editor/. Hud kept only the window construction, its two
    // mutation callbacks and the public opener, so the file lands 185 lines
    // below its old pin even after the wiring. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19078 -> 19076 by the bar editor's Clear control: the desktop
    // slot's two shift-clear listeners moved behind action_bar_clear.ts's own
    // bindShiftClear, and the editor's three mutation callbacks now share ONE
    // tooltip hide inside the window, which pays for the new clearSlot callback
    // with two lines to spare. Exact count, zero slack.
    // LOWERED 19076 -> 19052 by the touch stance radial: renderStanceBar's whole
    // body (the row's markup, its per-button tooltip and click wiring, and the
    // signature latch) moved behind a new hud/stance seam, and Hud kept the

    // staging/scene-bookkeeping logic that first cut left inline here (and
    // that inline copy is what hid the bug, an `Object3D.add` reparent that

    // unchecked.
    // Merging PR #3447 onto the corrected PR #3446 v0.39 wrapper leaves the

    // Merging approved PRs #3425 and #3447 into the moved-base v0.39 wrapper

    // PR #3468 changes the shadow-depth prewarm material contract, but this

    // (src/render/prewarm_depth_material.ts, PR #3468), the character-visual
    // pool take/store halves (src/render/characters/pooled_visual_lifecycle.ts,

    // Lowered again by the deferred-decal stand-in (the live candidate path

    // opening render scale into dynamic_resolution_core.ts (net -1).
    // Lowered again by the compile gate's piece cut (one queue unit per
    // material group of the target, compile_gate_pieces.ts): the enumeration
    // and the per-piece work live in that module, and the gate's rationale
    // comment was rewritten to the design that ships (net -10).
    // Lowered again by the hitch sample alignment (hitch_frame_align_core.ts:
    // the start-of-sync reading and the aligned end-of-sync sample), which
    // paid for its wiring by extracting the perfStats last-frame deep copy
    // into src/render/renderer_frame_stats_snapshot.ts (net -21).
    // Lowered again by the compile gate's variant settle
    // (program_variant_settle.ts, the third piece arm both gates bind), which
    // paid for its wiring by moving the open-air fog predicate beside the
    // FogSceneState it classifies (interior_light_rig.ts isOpenAirFogState),
    // landing with the shadow arm's every-mesh twin swap in the same change
    // (net -3).
    // Lowered again when the world gates' touch tail moved behind
    // linked_program_touch_lane.ts runWorldGateTouchLane (no walk mark, the
    // unproven walk recorded as a touch-unproven event) (net -2).
    // The upstream/main merge landed upstream's own growth (the mount-program
    // prewarm entry, the delve tracker extraction) on top of this branch's
    // extractions, so the pin is the exact merged count, still lower than
    // upstream main's own (13744), and any growth reds again.
    // RAISED 13546 -> 13548 (+2) by the streamed-prewarm branch. A raise, not a
    // lowering, and stated as one: the branch extracts the compile SUBMIT LOOP
    // with its deadline rule and never-drop contract
    // (runPrewarmCompileSubmission, src/render/prewarm_compile_submission_core.ts,
    // beside the per-unit submit that module already owned) and the weapon-skin
    // resume unit PLAN (weaponVfxPrewarmUnits, src/render/weapon_vfx_prewarm.ts,
    // beside the stage whose failure boundary shares its unit ids), and those
    // two extractions still do not quite cover what it adds.
    //
    // The history matters because it is the failure mode this ratchet exists to
    // catch. An earlier revision of this branch reported a NET REDUCTION while
    // deleting 41 lines of load-bearing comments, 11 blank lines and folding
    // three `let` declarations into one comma statement: the extractions were
    // real but the number was bought with formatting. Every comment is restored,
    // the blank lines are back, the declarations are separate again, and the
    // count below is what the extractions alone earn. Maintainer decision, and
    // deliberately a visible +2 rather than an invisible -9.
    // Re-pinned 13548 -> 13551 when the rift long-session perf branch merged
    // this base: both parents grew the file independently (upstream's interior
    // resource registry wiring, this branch's object-view material disposal,
    // sparkle tags and the rift build-key cooldown, all thin consumers of
    // extracted modules). Exact merged count, zero slack: any further growth
    // reds again.

    // cooldown swapped its untracked setTimeout (a handle that outlives
    // teardown and can fire into a recycled renderer) for a timestamp gate.
    // The gate logic lives in src/render/build_retry_gate.ts; this is the
    // coordinator's thin-wiring cost (import, field + rationale comment, the

    // Meanwhile on the release base: re-pinned 13548 -> 13563 (+15) when the
    // fast-loading-screen-variety branch merged release/v0.40.0 (thin-consumer
    // wiring to the onCharacterAssetReady seam; substance in
    // src/render/characters/assets.ts and visual.ts), then 13563 -> 13573
    // (+10) for its review-fix round (the nearby-view floor on the shared
    // prewarm budget, decision in src/render/prewarm_policy.ts, and the

    // Re-pinned to the exact count of the merged file: the base's 13573 plus

    // slack: any further growth reds again.
    // Entry-detail admission moved the settle step ahead of compile/texture

    // The release's rift lifecycle wiring brings the combined renderer to this

    // Review hardening restores the measured residency rationale at its live
