// The bug: the landing character-creation preview was gated on the site-wide
// assetsReady() promise with no failure handler. That promise covers EVERY
// registered preload (terrain, dungeon, foliage, character GLBs, ...), so a
// single transient failure ANYWHERE permanently sank the character preview
// with zero retry, most likely on a cold, first-visit cache (no warm HTTP
// cache to mask a flaky fetch). charactersReady() is the narrower fix: it
// only waits on character-boot assets and retries whatever is still missing,
// since loadGltf/loadTexture evict a failed URL from their cache on
// rejection, making a fresh call a real re-fetch attempt.
