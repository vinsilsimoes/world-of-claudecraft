// Chronomancy Phase 3 balance harness (docs/prd/mage-chronomancy.md 13.4 / 14).
// A deterministic, sim-driven measurement of the offensive Arcane rotation the
// owner signed off on: it drives the conservative and emergency rotations and
// the Piro/Cryo nuke baselines at level 20 / auto-equipped gear and measures
// DPS, effective Echo HPS, overheal, net mana spend, and time-to-OOM. The Aether
// Surge base mana cost was DERIVED here (owner directive): tuned so the
// conservative offensive rotation lasts ~70-80s at the real ~1506 pool.
//
// Targets asserted (owner, 2026-07-12), with the conservative-offensive window
// re-derived twice since: Spirit began regenerating mana in combat (the mp5
// change, ~75s to ~90s), and the v0.35.0 base sync's item-stat and
// construction-order changes slowed the net drain further (release alone
// measured 88.0s). The two compose (a slower drain gives the trickle longer to
// act), landing at 112.7s here. The reactive and emergency windows stay inside
// their original bands (their heavier spend outpaces the added trickle), so
// only the offensive band moved.
//   - conservative offensive rotation: ~100-110s to OOM (median over the seed trio),
//   - conservative + occasional Temporal Mend/Barrier: ~55-72s,
//   - emergency (hold 4 charges): 15-25s,
//   - conservative healing rotation at 50-65% of Piro and Cryo DPS over the same window.
//
// Fixtures and the policy runner live in tests/helpers/chronomancy_harness.ts
// (shared with the heal-parity and Cascada suites this file split from).
