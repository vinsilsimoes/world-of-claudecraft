// @vitest-environment happy-dom

// The Town Focus repaint gate (issue #2500).
//
// The panel is repainted from Hud.update()'s 500ms slow band, and the whole
// gate used to be `if (this.townFocusOpen)`. renderTownFocusWindow is a full
// skeleton wipe (innerHTML for the title bar, then createElement/appendChild
// for the hint block and every row), so an OPEN AND IDLE panel discarded and
// rebuilt its entire subtree twice a second, forever. It carried scrollTop
// across the wipe, which is itself the evidence the wipe was known to be
// destructive; focus was the case that got missed, and a keyboard user parked
// on a +/- stepper or Save had that element destroyed under them at 2Hz.
//
// Five layers are pinned here, mirroring tests/crafting_reagent_refresh.test.ts:
//  1. townFocusRenderSig (pure): it moves on every value the painter renders
//     and stays put on churn the painter cannot see.
//  2. That the sig's term set really is the painter's read set, scanned out of
//     the painter's own source, so a row that starts rendering another view
//     field cannot silently leave the gate behind.
//  3. The HUD probe's behavior, driven on a bare Hud prototype (the
//     crafting_reagent_refresh precedent, since the probe is private and
//     update() is not drivable in a unit test): cold latch, elision, the
//     in/out-of-town edge, and that a closed panel reads nothing at all.
//  4. The real painter in a real DOM: an unchanged poll rebuilds nothing and
//     keyboard focus survives it, and the rebuild that DOES happen (a step)
//     hands focus back to the rebuilt equivalent instead of dropping it to
//     <body>.
//  5. The wiring source pins for the three edges (the slow band, the paint
//     re-arm, the language switch), each anchored to the REGION it has to live
//     in rather than to the whole file.
//
// Section 6 is issue #2525, the other half of the same story. The panel was
// outside the shared FocusManager entirely, so it had no Tab trap, no
// return-to-opener and no dialog role. That gap was unreachable while the panel
// rebuilt itself at 2Hz (focus never survived long enough to be handed back),
// which is why it lands here, against the same painter and the same Hud
// methods, rather than in a file of its own.
