// The live composite pin. Mint history (kept from the previous in-place
// comments): re-pinned across the pnpm-lock migration (which moved the
// three GLB *SourceFingerprint leaves, since the lockfile is a hashed input
// of every GLB source fingerprint), and then across PR #2720's
// fence-removal layout evidence, the v0.34.0 Bear Form rig (#2842), the live
// graphics rebuild (#2799), far-field impostors and fog-free vista (#2793),
// brood shout/flourish wiring, the worldObjectBurning fire-burst cue, the
// Thornhollow renderer sync, and the release/v0.35.0 into AAA-enhancements
// merge, each of which moved a runtimeRender leaf (usually
// src/render/renderer.ts); every mint used
// scripts/assets/eastbrook_grand_armoury/remint_polish_provenance.mjs.
// Across all of those mints no GLB pipeline input or geometry value changed
// and no capture was retaken here: Eastbrook itself is untouched, and the
// one capture retake (by the release) was adopted verbatim with its swept
// metadata and performance JSONs. Re-derive whenever renderer.ts changes.
// On a mismatch the test prints the full diagnostics (moved leaves,
// dirty-input verdict, the one-step remint command) instead of a raw object
// diff; see provenance_diagnostics.mjs for the 2026-08-05 stale-mint root
// cause this legibility exists to prevent.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2982 merge: the release-side weapon-skin apply
// queue moves src/render/renderer.ts, and the PR-side ability VFX warm-up
// moves src/render/renderer.ts plus src/render/prewarm_policy.ts. Those
// runtimeRender leaves re-mint the composite. No Eastbrook input, geometry
// value, or capture moved.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2983 revert: the rendererIntegration leaf moved
// back while PR #2982's prewarm policy remains in the release.
// Re-pinned for the PR #2983 re-land: the weapon-skin apply queue and the
// vfx.weapon-skins prewarm entry move src/render/renderer.ts forward again,
// on top of the bow-aim renderer edit the release landed after the revert.
// No Eastbrook input, geometry value, or capture moved.
// Re-minted again for the second release/v0.35.0 merge (the swimming strokes PR
// and the v0.35.0 batch both move the renderer leaf on the release side).
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.35.0 into this branch: both sides moved
// the rendererIntegration leaf (the release's PR #2983 re-land, this branch's
// creator review pass), so the merged tree mints a value matching neither
// parent. Captures adopted verbatim; no measured value moved on either side.
// Re-minted for the VFX per-frame cost work: the rendererIntegration leaf
// follows the anchor seam, the weapon-skin fade and the census tag. No capture
// was retaken; every measured value is adopted verbatim.
// Re-minted for the iOS WebKit memory-profile fix (renderer.ts's
// nativeIosMemoryProfile -> iosMemoryProfile rename) landing on top of the VFX
// per-frame cost work already on this release branch. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (PR 3161) into the three
// compileAsync patch branch: the release side moved the rendererIntegration
// and townRuntime leaves while this branch's lockfile patch moved the GLB and
// source-fingerprint leaves, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted on PR 3150's v0.36.0 base merge: the branch's renderer.ts prewarm
// changes and the PR 3165 reseal converged here. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the bounded-prewarm point-light pin (renderer.ts edit only).
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the entry-prewarm compile dedupe/batch + initial-frame reserve
// (renderer.ts + prewarm_policy.ts edits). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the prewarm coverage completion (settle-state entry, program
// content keys, widened depth arm). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 into the render caches branch:
// the release-side prewarm compile and point-light reseals converge with this
// branch's bounded character-visual pool wiring on the rendererIntegration
// leaf, so the merged tree mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (post PR 3220/3221) into the KTX2
// mip-release branch: both parents move renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration
// leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.36.0 (post PR 3222) into the prewarm
// sky-unstarve branch: both parents move renderer.ts (this branch also moves
// prewarm_policy.ts; sky.ts moved too but is not a provenance input), so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review fixes on the prewarm sky-unstarve PR (deadlineExempt
// sky entry, unified view-cap trim rule, deferred-lane gate and priority
// threading; renderer.ts edits only). No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for review round 2 on the prewarm sky-unstarve PR (honest
// archetype and scene-texture counts; renderer.ts edits only). No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the shadow-batch PR (shadow-camera texel snapping and the
// budget-governed shadow cadence; renderer.ts edits only). No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of the shadow-batch PR with the iOS constrained-
// memory zone-eviction fix: both parents move renderer.ts, so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of PR #3314's rift windup telegraph school tint
// (issue #2917) with the release branch's renderer changes. Both parents move
// renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither
// parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the Three.js audit batch (light budget seam, blob shadows, sky
// residency lane, splat colour pack-source fix): renderer.ts edits only. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the base sync of the Three.js audit batch with the release
// branch renderer changes. Both parents move renderer.ts, so the
// rendererIntegration leaf mints a value matching neither parent. No capture
// was retaken.
// Re-minted for the release base-health repair after renderer.ts changed. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the v0.37.0 base sync with the login-storm base commit. The
// merged renderer/prewarm/source bytes mint a value matching neither parent.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after organizing renderer imports changed the provenance inputs.
// No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of the iOS constrained-memory zone-eviction fix
// (evictFarZoneIfConstrained) with the release branch's organized renderer
// imports. Both parents move renderer.ts, so the rendererIntegration leaf
// mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after the point-light adoption seam moved the fire-light budget
// pass out of renderer.ts into fire_light_registry.ts. renderer.ts is a
// provenance input, so its bytes move the composite. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted again for the review fixes on the same PR: the stranded-light
// reparent moved out of renderer.ts too, and the budget-pass descriptor became
// a pooled field. renderer.ts bytes only. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.38.0 into the night-lighting branch:
// both parents move renderer.ts (the release's point-light seam, this branch's
// moon-phase grade threading), so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for PR #3339's healGlowAt view-eviction fix on the newer release
// renderer. The rendererIntegration leaf moves; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for PR #3344 after removing the unused Eastbrook civic-beacon
// preload test hook. The civicShader leaf moves; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after applying the PR #3339 review repair atop PR #3344. The
// rendererIntegration and civicShader leaves both survive; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for final PR #3345 integration. The reviewed offscreen-heal
// renderer bytes remain while the new lockfile and accepted GLBs join the
// provenance inputs. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after extracting entity-view policy from renderer.ts to satisfy
// the release monolith ratchet. Behavior is unchanged; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted again after making that extracted policy an explicit provenance
// leaf. The evidence now follows policy-only changes; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of release/v0.38.0 into the Armory warming branch:
// both parents move renderer.ts, so the merged tree mints a value matching
// neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the quest-collectable spawn gate: this branch's renderer.ts
// edits (the view gate call sites and the ground-object pool key move) shift
// the runtimeRender.renderer leaf, the only leaf that moved. No Eastbrook
// input, geometry value, or capture moved.
// Re-minted for the merge of PR #3359's quest-collectable spawn gate with the
// release branch's extracted entity-view policy. Both renderer.ts and the
// entityViewPolicy leaf are provenance inputs; no capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review fixes on this branch (Soul Rend warms every rig a
// live body can take, plus the lazy form-visual fold): renderer.ts moves
// again, so the composite follows its bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the r185 frozen-camera aim fix: updateCamera now aims through
// lookAtFrozen, so renderer.ts moves and the composite follows its bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after extracting the delve interior build-cache scheduling into
// src/render/delve_interior_tracker.ts (renderer.ts moved again, no capture retaken).
// Re-minted again for the login preview/self-spirit prewarm merge with the
// delve interior tracker extraction. Renderer/prewarm bytes moved; captures
// were adopted verbatim.
// Re-minted for the sky KTX2 UASTC HDR conversion: the renderer publishes the
// sky module's held textures into the residency table and its idle sky upload
// comment follows the compressed path, so renderer.ts moves and the composite
// follows its bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the corrected PR #3446 merge: the v0.39 wrapper renderer and
// prewarm repairs combine with the sky KTX2 renderer bytes, so the merged tree
// mints a value matching neither parent. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the vfx.mount-programs prewarm entry (#2571): renderer.ts and
// prewarm_policy.ts both move, so the composite follows their bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the vfx.mount-programs review fixes (scene-reparent bug,
// honest desktop-path progress, depth compile, timeout-bounded fetch,
// constrained-device removal): renderer.ts and prewarm_policy.ts both move
// again, so the composite follows their bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the PR #3447 merge: the v0.39 wrapper, corrected PR #3446 sky
// KTX2 renderer bytes, and mount-program prewarm bytes combine in one tree. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the moved-base v0.39 wrapper refresh: the castle renderer bytes
// and v0.39 wrapper bytes combine in one tree. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the approved PR #3425 merge into the v0.39 wrapper: the
// resolved renderer bytes combine the delve tracker extraction with later
// wrapper fixes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after syncing current release/v0.39.0 into the v0.39 wrapper: the
// resolved renderer bytes retain the queued self-spirit prewarm and delve
// rebuild repair. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the GPU-preparation scheduler batch and its second and third
// passes (extractions, the upload lane, the present-host watch, the program
// signature fields and manifest ids in prewarm_policy.ts, the arrival and
// coverage wiring): both fingerprinted inputs moved, so the composite follows
// their bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the touch tail's readiness fix (the walk no longer asks the
// driver): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the build-ledger instrumentation (timed view and zone
// builds, the arrival mark): renderer.ts and entity_view_policy_core.ts
// moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the build-span sink wiring (view-part sub-spans): renderer.ts
// moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the composed-look pieces hold (live candidate path wiring):
// renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the gc hitch cause (the heap read on the hitch sample):
// renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for the deferred-decal stand-in (the live candidate path builds
// the body without its face decals): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the
// swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the compile gate's piece cut (one queue unit per material
// group of the target): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence
// bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the hitch sample alignment (the top-of-sync reading and the
// aligned end-of-sync sample): renderer.ts moved, the seals follow the swept
// evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the compile gate's variant settle (the third piece arm) and
// the shadow arm's every-mesh depth twin: renderer.ts moved, the seals follow
// the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the resume lane ordering (program debt before upload debt):
// prewarm_policy.ts moved, the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the three patch-hash bump in pnpm-lock.yaml: the lockfile is a
// hashed leaf of the town fingerprint, so the seals follow the swept evidence
// bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the merge of upstream/main into the GPU-preparation
// scheduler branch: both parents' renderer and prewarm bytes combine in one
// tree, so the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the second three patch-hash bump in pnpm-lock.yaml (the count 0
// instanced-mesh render-list skip): the lockfile is a hashed leaf of the town
// fingerprint, so the seals follow the swept evidence bytes. No capture was
// retaken.
// Re-minted for shader-memory-probes renderer instrumentation and VFX teardown
// extraction. The renderer leaf moved; no capture was retaken because both
// changes are behavior-neutral for the accepted visual evidence.
// Re-minted for the fast-loading-screen-variety merge with release/v0.40.0:
// the renderer runtime leaf moved on both sides of the merge (this branch's
// character asset-ready wiring, the release's shader-memory probes). No
// capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the review-fix round (the nearby-view floor in
// prewarm_policy.ts, the weapon-skin early-out wiring in renderer.ts):
// both runtime leaves moved. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted after merging release/v0.40.0 into the loading-hitch branch:
// renderer.ts combines mandatory entry admission with the release's rift
// long-session resource lifecycle changes. No capture was retaken.
// Re-minted for the loading review fixes (rebuild reveal gates, inactive
// horizon fast path, display-pacing admission, and restored rationale): the
// renderer integration leaf moved. No capture was retaken.
