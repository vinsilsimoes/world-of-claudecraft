// @vitest-environment happy-dom

// Behavioral pin for Hud.updateReliquaryTracker(), the one seam between the
// live world and the always-on #reliquary-tracker strip. The pure core is
// covered in tests/reliquary_tracker_view.test.ts and the painter's DOM
// contract in tests/reliquary_tracker_painter.test.ts, which left the method
// that FEEDS them both unpinned end to end: nothing said the persisted collapse
// setting reaches the view, nothing said the compact-touch chip flag needs BOTH
// body classes, and nothing said a pinned page really travels from the window's
// store into a tracker line.
//
// The rig is the reliquary_unlock_chat_link.test.ts one: Object.create over the
// real Hud.prototype with only the fields this method touches assigned onto the
// instance, so the assertions run the shipped code rather than a copy of it.
// The tracker view is the REAL reused container (makeReliquaryTrackerView), the
// container-reuse contract being what makes the immediate-assert style below
// necessary: the painter is handed the same object every build, so a captured
// reference is never a snapshot.
//
// The stub world is SIM-SHAPED (the offline shapes: a Map of earned deeds, an
// ownedMounts() call, live Sets), which the online mirror matches member for
// member (the IWorld parity pin); the one online-only state this rig also
// drives is the COLD mirror (the last describe below): before the first
// snapshot lands, ClientWorld answers with every surface empty and every
// completion() null, and the method must produce the hidden strip, not a
// throw.
