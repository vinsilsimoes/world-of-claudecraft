// status, 'enabled' means hardware; 'software only' or 'disabled' means Chromium fell back to
// SwiftShader, which a WebGL game must not silently run on. getGPUInfo('complete') resolves
// the actual adapter (glRenderer names the real GPU, e.g. "Apple M1", vs "SwiftShader") and
// auxAttributes.softwareRendering is Chromium's own verdict; its gpuDevice list is the one
// line that settles a hybrid-laptop support ticket from a single player-supplied main.log
// (both adapters present, wrong one active means the gpu_preference.cjs levers did not take
// effect). This MUST run after the GPU process has reported (call it on the window's
// did-finish-load, not at whenReady, where getGPUFeatureStatus can still return a
// pre-initialization 'disabled_off'). Runs again after every reload (crash recovery); an
// unchanged renderer reading is deduped to keep the log quiet. The log lines themselves are
