// Discord Rich Presence, in house.
//
// Discord's own SDK is a native dependency with a service of its own; the wire
// protocol it speaks to the locally running client is a JSON frame on a unix
// socket (a named pipe on Windows), which is small enough to own outright. That
// keeps the dependency set where CONTRIBUTING wants it and, more importantly,
// keeps every failure mode ours to decide: a player without Discord, a player
// who quits Discord mid-session, and a build whose app id was never registered
// all have to be non-events for the game.
//
// The rules that shape the state machine:
//
//  - CONSTRUCTION DOES NO IO. main.cjs builds this at module scope, before the
//    window exists, so the constructor may not touch a socket or arm a timer.
//    The first connection attempt happens when the game first has something to
//    show, which is also the earliest moment the connection is worth anything.
//  - ABSENCE IS SILENT. No Discord client means every candidate path fails, and
//    that is the common case for most players. It gets a debug line and a
//    backoff, never a warning and never a tight retry loop.
//  - A MISCONFIGURED APP ID IS TERMINAL. An unregistered client_id is answered
//    with a CLOSE frame before READY (probe-confirmed: {"code":4000,"message":
//    "Invalid Client ID"}). Retrying that would hot-loop against the daemon for
//    the whole session, so it is a one-line warning and a full stop.
//  - THE RATE LIMIT IS OURS TOO. Discord throttles presence updates (about one
//    per fifteen seconds), and the renderer's zone changes are not paced. The
//    floor here is trailing-edge: the LATEST desired activity is what lands,
//    intermediate ones are dropped rather than queued, because a presence line
//    that is four zones behind is worse than one that skipped four zones.
//
// Pure and dependency-injected (no electron import, and the socket factory
// arrives as a function), so tests/electron_discord_presence.test.ts drives
// every transition with a fake socket and fake timers.
