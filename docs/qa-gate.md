# The QA gate

World of ClaudeCraft uses multiple coding-agent runtimes, but one repository QA
contract. Every layer does one job at the cheapest useful boundary. Claude Code and
Codex have different entry points and share the same deterministic scripts and commands.

## Layers

| Layer | What runs | When | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Instant copy gate | `.claude/hooks/qa-stop.sh` through each runtime's Stop hook | End of an agent turn | Yes, on a hard-invariant hit |
| Deterministic floor | `.githooks/pre-push` | Before a push | Yes |
| Day-loop fast path | `npm run gate:fast` through `scripts/gate_fast.mjs` | While iterating (agents and mid/low-tier machines) | No (local only; not merge) |
| **Selective gate** | `node scripts/gate_select.mjs` | **Before implementation is called ready / pre-merge** | **Yes (the merge bar)** |
| Full local gate | `npm run gate` through `scripts/gate.mjs` | When you want the whole suite locally, or the planner falls back | Yes (deeper check) |
| Selective PR-tier CI | ci.yml `pr-gate` shards through `scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs` (same selection semantics, sharded; full suite on any unprovable diff) | Every pull request | Yes (required checks) |
| Merge queue | ci.yml on the `merge_group` event: the full PR tier over the exact merge result about to become the branch tip (see `docs/merge-queue.md`, including rollout status: `release/**` first, `main` at the next release-to-main merge) | Every queued merge into a queue-protected branch | Yes (required checks on the merge group) |
| Nightly full gate | `.github/workflows/nightly.yml`: full suite + checks + browser over the tips of main and the active `release/**` branch | Scheduled nightly (04:47 UTC) | No (alerting: files and closes one tracking issue) |
| Judgment review | Claude `/qa` or Codex `$woc-qa`, plus scoped reviewers | End of a contribution | Advisory locally |

### Instant copy gate

The Stop gate scans the uncommitted added lines (the tracked diff against HEAD, staged
and unstaged, plus untracked text files) for an em dash, en dash, emoji, focused
`.only(` test, leftover `debugger`, or a `Math.random`/`Date.now`/`performance.now`
call added under `src/sim/` (the determinism invariant's instant tripwire). The locale
overlays and `docs/i18n/*.ru_RU.md` are excluded, matching the pre-push copy scan. It
takes milliseconds and never runs TypeScript, Vitest, Biome, browser work, or an agent.
`.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` share the Claude implementation; the
Codex adapter (`.codex/hooks/qa-stop.sh`) delegates to it, then re-scans TOML and
`.mts`/`.cts` module files (the shared filter now covers those itself, so the adapter's
extra pass is a harmless belt). A companion `PreToolUse` hook
(`.claude/hooks/deny-generated-edit.sh`) blocks direct agent edits to generated
artifacts (`*.generated.ts`, the `i18n.resolved.generated/` bundles) at the tool-call
boundary.

### Deterministic floor

`.githooks/pre-push` runs the heavier fast checks at the push boundary: TypeScript,
determinism and purity guards, i18n matcher guards, Biome on changed files, and copy
checks over the push diff. The shared `.claude/hooks/ensure-hooks.sh` idempotently points
`core.hooksPath` at `.githooks`; both agent runtimes call it at session start.

`git push --no-verify` remains an emergency bypass, not a substitute for reporting and
fixing a red gate.

### Day-loop fast path (`gate:fast`)

`npm run gate:fast` is a **high-signal subset** for agent and day-to-day loops. It is
**not** the merge contract and does **not** replace `npm run gate`.

On Windows, the runner transports the potentially large Vitest argument list through
a versioned temporary JSON manifest. This avoids the platform command-line limit
without narrowing the selected test set; the manifest is deleted after the child
process exits.

It runs, in order:

1. Malware gate (`security:gate`, typically a few seconds)
2. Biome on changed files (`ci:changed`)
3. Determinism / purity and i18n-matcher guards (`tests/architecture.test.ts`,
   `tests/localization_fixes.test.ts`)
4. Incremental TypeScript check (`check:ts` only; not admin `svelte-check`)
5. Vitest for changed code: `vitest related` on working-tree source files plus any
   changed test files (`--passWithNoTests`). `package.json` / vite config dirtiness is
   **not** expanded through `vitest --changed` (that would re-run nearly the full suite).

It deliberately skips full unsharded vitest, browser regressions, SFX conformance,
i18n generate/freshness, wiki content, and env/server/client builds. Those stay on the
full gate. Vitest workers still use `computeGateWorkers` (CPU/2 and available-memory clamp;
the sensor is `scripts/lib/gate_memory.mjs`, which reads `vm_stat` on macOS because
`os.freemem()` under-reports availability there).
Optional `GATE_WORKER_TIER=low|medium|high` caps workers after that clamp; see
[`docs/local-gate-perf/tier-workers.md`](local-gate-perf/tier-workers.md). Opt in to
branch-wide `vitest --changed <ref>` with `GATE_FAST_BASE=<ref>` when you deliberately
want that broader (and slower) selection. **Which command for your tier / agent vs
human:** [`docs/local-gate-perf/platform-matrix.md`](local-gate-perf/platform-matrix.md)
(macOS verified; Linux smoke via CI; Windows smoke until a host fills the matrix).

For a narrower loop without malware/biome/types, use the thin wrappers (same Vitest CLI;
not a merge bar):

```bash
npm run test:related -- path/to/changed.ts   # vitest related --run --passWithNoTests
npm run test:changed                         # vitest run --changed (uncommitted)
npm run test:changed -- origin/release/v0.34.0
```

`test:changed` expands almost to the full suite when `package.json` or `vite.config.ts`
is dirty (same reason `gate:fast` skips those paths for related expansion). Prefer
`test:related` with explicit sources, or `gate:fast`, for day-to-day work. Vitest
`experimental.fsModuleCache` is on in `vite.config.ts` so warm re-runs reuse module
transforms under `node_modules/.experimental-vitest-cache` (clear with
`npx vitest --clearCache` if a warm run looks wrong). The same store is persisted
across CI runs since Phase 4 of the CI/CD performance packet: the pr-gate and
release-gate shard jobs carry an `actions/cache` step for it, keyed per shard, and the
two long-sims lane jobs carry the same step keyed per lane half (Phase 6, the recorded
Phase 4 rider), all over the node_modules-layout inputs (lockfile, vite config, `.npmrc`,
`package.json`), with the design constraints written on the pr-gate copy of the step in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` and pinned by `tests/ci_workflow.test.ts`. The nightly gate deliberately stays cold: it is the
uncached full replay. Most DOM-environment unit
tests use `// @vitest-environment happy-dom`; a short exception list still pins
`jsdom` where happy-dom API gaps bite (see `docs/local-gate-perf/baselines.md`
Phase 5). Default environment remains `node`.

### Full local gate

`npm run gate` (or `pnpm run gate`) is the **full CI mirror, the deeper check behind the
selective merge bar** (`gate:select`, below, is the bar itself). It mirrors CI:
generated i18n and build-manifest freshness, malware scanning, changed-file formatting, the SFX conformance
check, the full test suite, the browser regression suite (`npm run test:browser`, which
drives Chromium through Playwright), the typecheck, and env, server, bot, and client
builds. Release branches use the release i18n tier. It stops at the first failure and
bounds Vitest workers to avoid load flakes on shared machines. It resolves FFmpeg
(`ffmpeg` and `ffprobe`) from the bundled `ffmpeg-static`/`ffprobe-static` npm packages,
falling back to PATH, and refuses to run when neither source yields a working binary.

**Full-suite lock across concurrent gates (issue #2808):** per-process worker sizing
protects a gate run from itself, but does nothing when a second `npm run gate` is
running in a sibling worktree, which this repo's own per-task-worktree workflow makes
routine; two gates that each correctly claim half the cores still request the whole
machine between them. `gate.mjs` acquires an advisory lock (`scripts/lib/gate_lock.mjs`,
an exclusive loopback listener shared by every worktree on the host) around the
`vitest (full suite)` step only, never the rest of the run. The kernel's atomic listener
ownership admits one gate at a time and disappears with its process, so recovery never
deletes a raced lock file or trusts a reusable pid. A gate that finds the listener held
waits and prints who holds it; a non-gate service on the reserved port is identified and
bypassed rather than blocking local work. The locked npm/Vitest step runs in a managed
child process group, so handled termination tears down the active workload before
releasing ownership. `GATE_NO_LOCK=1` restores fully concurrent behavior for a user who
deliberately wants two full suites running at once.
`gate_select.mjs`/`gate_fast.mjs` never touch this lock; it exists for the one step
that is actually the shared-host bottleneck.

**Task cache (Turborepo):** pure artifact steps (`i18n:gen`, `wiki:content`, `sfx:check`,
`check:types`, `build:env`, `build:server`, `build:bot`, `build:bundle`) run through `npx turbo run`
with inputs/outputs in root `turbo.json`. A warm second gate on an unchanged tree
replays those steps from `.turbo/` (often under a second). Full vitest, browser tests,
malware, changed-file Biome, and the i18n freshness `git diff` always run (they are not
cached as "passed"). Catalog edits under `src/ui/i18n.catalog/**` invalidate `i18n:gen`.
Contributor detail: [`docs/local-gate-perf/task-cache.md`](local-gate-perf/task-cache.md).

Use this command instead of an ad hoc shell pipeline whenever you want the whole suite
locally; the pre-merge bar itself is the selective gate (next section). Piping a test
run can hide its exit status, and unconstrained full-suite parallelism can make healthy
heavy sim tests flake. Day-loop iteration may use `npm run gate:fast`; a green fast path
alone is never enough to claim done.

The MIR4 persistence and online release proof is intentionally real-engine
rather than a mock inside the full suite. CI's required `MIR4 PostgreSQL 16
proof` job starts a disposable PostgreSQL 16 service and runs
`tests/character_lease_pg_integration.test.ts` plus
`tests/mir4_save_v2_pg_integration.test.ts` with
`WOC_REQUIRE_PG_INTEGRATION=1`. Locally those files remain opt-in through
`TEST_DATABASE_URL`; without it they skip, while setting the require flag without
the URL fails at module load. The job covers migration fencing, both
save/takeover lock orders, expiry during a wait, JSONB size, diagnostic WAL and
the 1,000-session/concurrency-four autosave-cycle budget, including its lease
heartbeat. It then builds the MIR4 client/server against that same disposable
database and runs `scripts/mp_integration.mjs` and `scripts/mp_browser.mjs`, so
the required check also proves the native roster, authoritative owner snapshot,
reconnect, mutual visibility, movement, chat and existing-HUD profile gates over
the real HTTP/WebSocket/browser stack.

### Selective gate (`gate:select`)

`node scripts/gate_select.mjs` is **the merge bar** (owner decision, 2026-08-05; recorded in
`docs/local-gate-perf/state.md`). `npm run gate` remains the deeper check. The one-line
difference from the other paths:

| | Non-test steps | Tests | Merge bar? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `gate:fast` | **A subset.** No builds, no admin/bot typecheck, no i18n or wiki freshness, no sfx, no browser. | `related` plus two guard files | **No** |
| `gate` | **All**, plus the dep-sync and ffmpeg preflights | **Every** test file | Yes (provably complete) |
| `gate:select` | **All, and the same preflights** | ONE merged `related` (floor seeds + sources) | Yes (empirically complete) |

The distinction that matters: **`gate:fast` is weaker because it drops whole checks;
`gate:select` drops none of them.** A change that breaks the client bundle, the admin
Svelte types, the bot build, i18n freshness, or SFX conformance fails `gate:select`
exactly as it fails `gate`, and on a `release/**` branch it runs the release-tier i18n
step too. Only the test step is narrowed, so the question "is this enough to ship a PR"
reduces to one question: does the narrowed test step still catch what the full one would?

**Why the narrowed test step is sufficient.** `vitest related` selects on the static
import graph, which models most of this suite correctly and misses the rest *silently*
(a skipped test does not error, so the gate still prints PASS). So selection is never
trusted alone. `scripts/lib/test_visibility.mjs` classifies every test file first:

- **blind**: reaches outside the graph (disk scan, subprocess, dynamic import, or an
  fs-touching shared helper one hop away) and imports no source. `related` can never
  select it. `tests/architecture.test.ts`, the determinism and sim-purity guard, is one
  of these.
- **partial**: reaches outside the graph *and* imports source, so `related` selects it
  only sometimes, which hides better than never.
- **graph**: pure imports, modelled correctly.

Discovery matches vitest's own collection rule rather than approximating it, because a
walker that misses a file the suite runs removes it from the always-run set silently.

Every blind and partial file runs on **every** selective gate regardless of the diff.
Only the graph-visible remainder is left to `related`. The set is recomputed from source
on each run rather than read from a committed list, so it cannot go stale: a new test that
scans from disk joins it the moment it lands.

**Safety fallback.** Any change the planner cannot reason about (a lockfile, `package.json`,
a vite/vitest/tsconfig edit, the shared test helpers or global setup) drops the whole run
to the full suite. Two deliberate carve-outs: the regenerated i18n artifacts and the
three committed build manifests (`src/game/sfx_manifest.generated.ts`,
`src/guide/content.generated.ts`, `src/render/assets/manifest.generated.ts`) never
widen; each family classifies into its own bucket and is fed to `related` as graph
nodes (see "Generated i18n artifacts" under the CI section below; the same shared
classifier serves both arms, and the local gate's own freshness steps, i18n and
manifest, are the local half of the safety argument). Selection is an optimization for
changes we understand; everything else gets the old bar. Failing toward *more* tests
is the only safe direction, which is also why
an unresolvable diff base or a failing `git diff` is a hard stop rather than an empty
changed set. The diff is taken against the BRANCH base, not just the dirty working tree:
`GATE_SELECT_BASE` overrides it, otherwise the tracking branch is used.

**Reading a shadow run.** It reports two numbers. *Escapes* (a file the full suite
failed that selection skipped) is the strict signal, but it is empty on any green
branch regardless of how sound selection is, so a green run is explicitly labelled
INCONCLUSIVE on escapes rather than PASS. The *coverage delta* (files the full suite
ran that selection skipped) exists on every run: it is not a defect list, it is the
surface where an escape could hide, and it is what to actually study.

**What it still cannot prove, and why that is acceptable.** The out-of-graph pattern list is
a floor, not a proof, so this path is empirically complete rather than provably complete.
The backstops are the runs that stay unconditionally full: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs
the FULL suite on every push to `main` / `release/**` (release pushes as the plain 8-shard
matrix; main/dev pushes through the PR tier's shards-plus-long-sims-lane layout, full
mode, since selection applies to pull requests only, next section), and the scheduled
nightly full gate re-proves the tips daily with same-day alerting. A selection miss
therefore surfaces at merge-to-release time or the same night, never later, and the
release branch is the safety net the packet designed it to be.

### Selective PR-tier CI (`ci_shard_test.mjs`)

Since Phase 2 of the CI/CD performance packet, the
`pull_request` tier of `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the SAME selection semantics as
`gate:select`, sharded 8 ways. The `changes` job derives a `test_mode` from the same
API-fetched file listing that decides `code` (`scripts/lib/ci_test_select.mjs`), and each
`pr-gate` shard builds its legs through `scripts/lib/ci_shard_plan.mjs` via
`scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs`: in full mode, the old `npm test -- --shard=i/8` step minus
the long-sims lane files (below); in selective mode, ONE merged sharded `vitest related`
leg over the changed sources plus the floor files as self-selecting seeds (vitest seeds
its affected set with the given paths themselves; the property is pinned by execution in
`tests/ci_shard_plan.test.ts`). The entry regenerates the generated artifacts once per
job before spawning, since `npx vitest` has no npm lifecycle.

**The long-sims lanes** (Phase 4; split in two by the lane-diet PR). The
`CI_LONG_SUITES` files (`scripts/lib/ci_shard_plan.mjs`: the suites measured over 90
seconds inside a full-mode shard, the chronomancy balance sweep among them, plus the
owned-class balance family, which is lane-owned as a unit since its 2026-08-13 split
so the diet-flag registry and its lane accounting stay in one place; the measured
per-file lane duration ledgers live in the lane-split PR bodies, #3370 first) run in the
dedicated `PR long sims A` / `PR long sims B` job pair
(`node scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs --lane=long-sims-a` / `--lane=long-sims-b`, one
`CI_LONG_SUITE_HALVES` half each), and every shard leg excludes the whole union, so a
single multi-minute file no longer sets the slowest shard's wall clock and the lane's
own wall clock is the slower HALF, not the whole list. Completeness is a pinned
invariant, not an intention: each lane fails closed to its whole half on exactly the
inputs that make a shard fail closed to full, the shard legs exclude exactly the files
the two lanes own between them, and in selective mode each lane runs just its half's
lane files the floor or the PR's diff would have carried (the merged leg's related side stays
unfiltered, so a reached lane file re-runs there: duplicate work, never a gap). Mode for
mode, the ten PR-tier test jobs together therefore run exactly what the pre-lane
8-shard layout would have run (`tests/ci_shard_plan.test.ts` pins the partition;
selective mode still skips the outside-floor remainder by design, exactly as before the
lane). The latency win is concentrated in FULL mode: most lane files are
graph-visible, so on a sim-heavy selective PR the merged leg's related side pulls them back into a
shard exactly as the old related legs did before the lane, and only the blind members (plus any lane
test the PR itself changed) ride the lanes.
The lanes reproduce locally with
`node scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs --lane=long-sims-a --plan-only` (and `-b`), printing the
same `[ci-shard]` audit lines as the shards. `release-gate` is deliberately not
lane-split: `release/**` pushes keep the full suite in their 8 shards; a push to `main`
or `dev-*` runs the PR tier, so it gets the shards-plus-lanes layout.

**The sparse test-job checkout.** The five sparse CI test jobs (the pr-gate shards,
both long-sims lanes, release-gate, release-i18n) check out a blobless non-cone sparse
set: everything in, `docs/screenshots` DIRECTORIES out (root-level files stay), and
every subtree the repo references back in. The re-include list is DERIVED, not
curated: `tests/ci_workflow.test.ts` recomputes the referenced set over tests,
scripts, src, and all of docs minus the screenshots tree itself (acceptance manifests
carry evidence paths suites follow at runtime; a test-literal-only coupling shipped
once and went red on exactly that), with existence taken from the git index because
an excluded directory does not exist on disk under the cone being verified. A new
reference to an un-coned subtree fails that pin in the same change. `pr-checks`,
`browser-gate`, and `release-checks` deliberately keep the full tree.

**Declared duration budgets.** `tests/suite_duration_budget.test.ts` is the anti-whale
ratchet: it reads every DECLARED vitest timeout under `tests/` (all `.ts`/`.mjs`, so
`.test.mjs` files and `vi.setConfig` allowances in imported helpers count too) through
the masking parser in `tests/helpers/declared_timeouts.ts` (comments and string
contents can never count; only registration-head positions do; the diet arm of a
sweep ternary; same-file constants resolve, and an unresolvable identifier FAILS the
suite rather than vanishing). It enforces two conscious-decision rules in the
`monolith_budget` mold: a single test or hook may not declare more than the
worker-chain cap without an exact exception row (one test is one worker chain and
cannot parallelize, which is how the pre-split owned-class harness came to set whole
job walls), and a file whose summed allowance exceeds the default needs an exact
ledger row, with splitting along cost clusters as the preferred remedy. It reads
allowances, not runtimes, so lane membership stays a MEASURED decision owned by
`CI_LONG_SUITES` and its 90-second rule; the guard classifies onto the always-run
floor and is also named in `CI_GUARD_SUITES` as drift insurance.

**The balance-harness diet.** The heavy balance suites in the lane are regression
tripwires, not measurements (the authoritative instrument is the offline Monte Carlo
sweep), so at PR time they run a reduced configuration: fewer fixed seeds, the
band-carrying scenarios only, and shorter windows where a coefficient change still
shows inside the first minute. `WOC_FULL_BALANCE_SWEEP=1`, set only by the nightly
workflow's test job, restores the full five-seed, all-scenario, 120-second
configuration nightly. That scoping is deliberate and complete: `release/**` push
runs, merge-queue runs, and the local `npm run gate` all run the diet configuration
too (they run every test FILE, at diet depth), and the nightly is the ONE surface
that runs the full sweep. `tests/ci_workflow.test.ts` pins the flag OUT of ci.yml
and `tests/ci_shard_plan.test.ts` pins exactly which suites read it, so neither a
new diet nor a stray full-sweep can land silently. Every band is pinned to a measurement at its own configuration
(the diet bands were re-derived with the same relative margins as the full bands they
mirror; the lane-diet PR body carries the measurement table). When you change balance
and a band moves, re-pin BOTH configurations from their own printed actuals; never
carry one configuration's band under the other, and never shorten a window that guards
long-fight behavior (mana sustain, time-to-OOM).

The CI floor is a superset of the local one: every blind/partial test (recomputed in the
PR's own tree via the shared `collectSuiteVisibility`), PLUS the invariant guard suites by
name (`tests/architecture.test.ts`, the localization guards, `tests/world_api_parity.test.ts`,
and everything under `tests/parity/`), PLUS every test file the PR changed. CI also widens
on triggers the local gate does not need: any `.github/` path, the selection pipeline's own
scripts (a PR runs its own copy of them), any removed or renamed source/test path (a
deleted module's importers are invisible to `related`), and any listing it cannot relay or
read safely. Selection never applies off `pull_request` events: a merge-queue run
(`merge_group`) always takes `test_mode=full` (the queue is the last pre-merge bar),
`release-gate` keeps the unconditional full 8-shard run line, and the nightly gate
re-proves the tips daily.

**Generated i18n artifacts.** The regenerated i18n artifacts (the per-locale resolved
slices directly under `src/ui/i18n.resolved.generated/` and
`src/admin/i18n.resolved.generated/`, and
`src/ui/i18n.catalog/translation_keys.generated.ts`) classify into their own bucket
(`isGeneratedI18nArtifactPath` in `scripts/lib/gate_select_plan.mjs`) instead of the
unrecognized-widen-to-full catch-all, so a PR that carries a routine regeneration no
longer forces the full suite: before this rule they were the single dominant full
trigger (8 of the 25 PRs replayed in Phase 2 went full SOLELY on them). The standing
rests on three structural facts, each pinned:

1. **Integrity is owned by the freshness step, which selection never touches.** The
   `pr-checks` job (and `release-checks`, and the full local gate's i18n step) reruns
   `npm run i18n:gen` and fails on `git diff --exit-code` over EXACTLY the artifact
   paths, gated only on `code` (any `src/` change), never on `test_mode`. A hand-edited
   or stale artifact is therefore a red check in every mode. `tests/ci_workflow.test.ts`
   pins the classifier's path list to the workflow's freshness-diff list AND to the
   local gate's `I18N_ARTIFACTS` list, so the copies cannot drift apart silently.
2. **Coverage is owned by the import graph, with the artifacts as entry nodes.** The
   artifacts are INSIDE the module graph, and are its most-connected i18n node
   (`src/ui/i18n.ts` statically imports and re-exports the resolved barrel); their
   DRIVING sources (catalog modules, locale overlays) are build inputs the runtime
   reaches only through type-erased edges, so `related` over a driving source selects
   almost nothing. Both arms therefore feed the changed artifact paths THEMSELVES to
   `vitest related`, which walks the real graph to every consumer, including suites
   that pin resolved-table content through the `src/ui/i18n.ts` re-export seam without
   ever naming an artifact (measured: a single resolved slice reaches about 240 of the
   2296 suites; a locale-fill PR runs the floor plus that set instead of everything).
   The `generated-i18n` entry in `OUT_OF_GRAPH_PATTERNS` is a belt over this, not the
   mechanism: it floors the direct artifact-naming importers on every selective run,
   with witnesses floored SOLELY by it (`tests/i18n_lazy_loader.test.ts`,
   `tests/i18n_dialect_resolution.test.ts`) pinned in `tests/gate_select_plan.test.ts`.
   The shard entry also regenerates the artifacts once per job before its legs run,
   so selected suites always assert over fresh content.
3. **Deletions and unprovable shapes widen.** The freshness diff cannot flag a
   deleted-then-regenerated file (regeneration recreates it UNTRACKED, and `git diff`
   never shows untracked files), so a removed or renamed-away artifact forces full in
   the mode decision (statuses), the shard plan re-proves presence with the checkout the
   changes job lacks, and the local planner takes an existence probe and widens without
   one. Membership is top-level only: the generator's orphan sweep does not recurse, so
   a SUBDIRECTORY path under an artifact dir is not freshness-provable and keeps the
   unrecognized widen. Every OTHER `.generated` tree keeps the old behavior:
   unrecognized, widen. Do not extend the artifact list without a freshness-equivalent
   proof AND the `tests/ci_workflow.test.ts` coupling.

**Committed build manifests.** The three committed build manifests
(`src/game/sfx_manifest.generated.ts`, `src/guide/content.generated.ts`,
`src/render/assets/manifest.generated.ts`) hold the SAME standing through the same
three facts, as the second and only other freshness-guarded family
(`GENERATED_MANIFEST_ARTIFACT_FILES` in `scripts/lib/gate_select_plan.mjs`): both check
jobs and the nightly checks job regenerate them (the `wiki:content && build:bundle`
step; regeneration is deterministic and sub-second per generator), prove every output
remains tracked with `git ls-files --error-unmatch`, and `git diff --exit-code` the FULL
output set; both arms feed the changed .ts paths to `vitest
related` as graph nodes; deletions and renames widen, the shard plan re-proves
presence, and the local planner widens without an existence probe. The freshness diff
set is a strict SUPERSET of the classifier family: the SFX generator also writes
`public/audio/sfx/runtime-pack.json` and `scripts/sfx/sfx_gain_ceiling.generated.json`,
which are diffed for integrity (a partial diff would let the local gate silently heal
them mid-run while CI reads stale committed copies) but never declassified, since
fs-read data is not a graph node. The local gate regenerates the SFX and media
manifests in their own steps (the wiki content regenerates in the artifacts turbo step),
proves the whole set remains tracked, and diffs it as its `manifest freshness` step.
`tests/ci_workflow.test.ts` welds the classifier list, both check jobs' trackedness and
diff argv, and
the local gate's `MANIFEST_ARTIFACTS` to each other. Membership is exact files, no
prefixes.

Every decision prints in the job log (`[detect_code_changes]` in the changes job,
`[ci-shard]` in each shard: mode, reason, floor size, related sources, and the
outside-floor count), so a suspicious green is auditable at a glance. To reproduce a CI
decision locally: `TEST_MODE=... CHANGED_FILES='[...]' node scripts/ci_shard_test.mjs
--shard=1/8 --plan-only` (`--plan-only` spawns nothing, so it works on any platform;
the real run path is POSIX-only by design). Pins: `tests/ci_test_select.test.ts`,
`tests/ci_shard_plan.test.ts`, `tests/ci_selection_pipeline.test.ts` (the trigger list
matches the pipeline's real import closure), and the workflow shape in
`tests/ci_workflow.test.ts`.

What the selective PR tier still cannot prove: the merge-result INTERACTION between
the PR's diff and base commits that landed after the PR's merge base. The shards check
out the merge ref (the PR merged onto the current base tip), but selection derives
from the PR's own changed files, so a test that only fails in the combination of a PR
change and a newer base change is outside both the floor and the related set. On the
queue-protected branches (`main` and `release/**`, see `docs/merge-queue.md`) the merge
queue closes this pre-merge: every queued PR is retested with the FULL suite on the
exact merge result against the current tip before it may land. The full-suite run on
every `release/**` push still re-proves the landed tip, and the nightly re-proves it
daily.

**Known-flake handling** (Phase 6). The shard and lane legs run through
`scripts/lib/ci_leg_runner.mjs`, which streams each leg's output through with
backpressure while keeping a bounded tail, and applies the ONE sanctioned automatic
retry: a leg that exits 1 while its vitest summary shows every test passed, carries the
exact unhandled `EnvironmentTeardownError: [vitest-worker]: Closing rpc while
"onUserConsoleLog" was pending` message (the worker-teardown console-log race, first
recorded 2026-08-05), and whose summary `Errors` count is fully explained by teardown-rpc
occurrences (so a run also carrying any OTHER unhandled error never retries) is rerun
once, with a loud `[ci-shard] known-flake retry` banner in the job log, a GitHub warning
annotation on the run, and a `(known-flake retry used on: ...)` suffix on the PASS line,
so a green that used the retry is auditable at a glance. At most ONE retry per job,
shared across all its legs. Any failed test, any other exit code, a signal kill, a spawn
error, or any unexplained unhandled error fails the job exactly as before: the packet's
non-goals forbid a blanket retry because retries hide real regressions. Be precise about
what the guarantee is: test output is not a trust boundary (a test already executes
arbitrary code in the job), so the summary parse is a narrowing filter, not integrity;
the property that holds is the policy itself, at most one rerun of the same leg per job,
always visible in the log. Classifier and policy live in
`scripts/lib/teardown_rpc_flake.mjs` and `scripts/lib/ci_leg_runner.mjs`, pinned by
`tests/teardown_rpc_flake.test.ts` and `tests/ci_leg_runner.test.ts`. `release-gate`,
the nightly, and the local gate carry NO auto-retry: there a teardown-rpc red stays red
and the remedy remains a manual rerun of the red shard
(`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`).

A separate reactor handles the checkout-stall class (a runner that hangs before tests
even start): `.github/workflows/ci-stall-rerun.yml` drives `scripts/ci_stall_rerun.mjs`
to rerun runs killed by that narrow signature, and the driver can be invoked by hand
for a stalled run. Triage recipes for both classes: the `ci-triage` skill.

**Evidence it works.** Fault injection, 5/5 caught: a `Math.random()` in `src/sim`, a combat
constant, a content record, a sim-emitted player string, and a deleted weapon `.glb`. In two
of those (`Math.random` and the asset deletion) `vitest related` selected **nothing** and
exited green; the always-run set caught both. That is the mechanism doing precisely the job
it exists for.

**No `npm run` alias yet, deliberately.** `tests/fenbridge_town_assets.test.ts`
fingerprints the whole of `package.json` as an input to a shipping GLB, so adding a
script entry invalidates the asset and demands a full re-export (63 files: preview
PNGs, raw and optimized GLBs). Rather than put that churn in a tooling change, this
ships as a direct `node` invocation. Adding the alias is a follow-up that either
re-exports the asset or narrows the fingerprint to the dependency fields, which is
the toolchain-relevant part its own comment cites as the reason for the pin.

Pure planning logic: `scripts/lib/gate_discovery.mjs`, `scripts/lib/gate_select_plan.mjs`
and `scripts/lib/test_visibility.mjs`, all pinned by `tests/gate_select_plan.test.ts`.

### Nightly full gate (scheduled backstop)

`.github/workflows/nightly.yml` re-proves the tips of `main` and the highest
`release/vX.Y.Z` branch (the `v` is optional) every night: the full unsharded test suite, the serialized
checks lane (mirroring ci.yml's release-checks run steps), and the Chromium browser
lane, per ref. It exists because a red release tip once sat unwatched for days while
every open PR inherited its failures; push runs show rot, but only to someone looking.

The verdict lands in exactly one tracking issue (label `nightly-gate`, title "Nightly
full gate is red"): created on the first red run, updated with the failed-job list on
repeat failures, closed with a recovery comment on the first green run. A run that
reports no failures but did not actually complete its lanes counts as red ("unproven"),
never as recovery. A `workflow_dispatch` with the `ref` input gates exactly that ref and
reports under the separate `nightly-gate-drill` identity, so acceptance drills never
touch the production issue; nothing scheduled drains a red drill's issue, so close it
by hand or finish the drill with a green dispatch at the same ref.

Deliberate exclusions: the release-i18n 21-locale lane (expected red mid-cycle, issue
#2820) and the release version gate (cannot rot without a push, which ci.yml covers).
GitHub registers a workflow's cron AND its `workflow_dispatch` surface from the default
branch, so neither can fire until the file reaches `main` with a release merge; the
first drill and the first manual pass both come after that.
Planning logic: `scripts/lib/nightly_plan.mjs`, pinned by `tests/nightly_plan.test.ts`;
the workflow shape is pinned by `tests/nightly_workflow.test.ts`.

### Judgment review

Reasoning is required for determinism, host parity, server authority, persistence,
localization, rendering and UI seams, mobile behavior, graphics fairness, content
fidelity, security, performance, and decisive coverage.

- Claude Code uses `/qa` (`.claude/skills/qa/`), `qa-checklist`, and `.claude/agents/`.
- Codex uses `$woc-qa` (`.agents/skills/woc-qa/`) and `.codex/agents/`.

The coordinator establishes one diff and runs commands once. It dispatches only relevant
read-only reviewers, gives them the shared evidence, and verifies consequential findings
before reporting readiness.

## Reviewer coverage

| Concern | Claude role | Codex role |
|---|---|---|
| Simulation architecture | `architecture-reviewer` | `woc_sim_architecture` |
| Cross-host parity | `cross-platform-sync` | `woc_cross_platform` |
| Persistence and migrations | `migration-safety` | `woc_persistence` |
| Database performance | `database-performance-reviewer` | `woc_database_performance` |
| Server hot-path performance | `server-hot-path-reviewer` | (not yet mirrored) |
| Privacy and security | `privacy-security-review` | `woc_security` |
| Decisive tests | `test-coverage-auditor` | `woc_test_coverage` |
| Frontend and graphics | `frontend-seam-reviewer` | `woc_frontend` |
| Release malware | `release-malware-audit` | `woc_release_malware` |
| Content same-change obligations | `content-obligations-reviewer` | (not yet mirrored) |
| Gate/CI selection integrity | `gate-integrity-reviewer` | (not yet mirrored) |

These roles encode non-obvious review heuristics. Canonical architecture stays in root
and local `CLAUDE.md` files. Content-obligations review owns the same-change authoring
duties of any `src/sim/content/` diff (deeds, Reliquary pages, wiki regen, item art,
name fills, referential integrity). Gate-integrity review owns changes to the selection
pipeline itself (`scripts/gate*.mjs`, `scripts/lib/gate_*.mjs`, `scripts/lib/ci_*.mjs`,
`scripts/lib/test_visibility.mjs`, the workflows and their pins), where the failure mode
is silently skipped tests. Persistence review owns
compatibility, save/load shape, and rollback safety. Database-performance review owns query cadence, cardinality, plans,
indexes, pool pressure, locks, timeout scope, write amplification, driver/dependency upgrades,
PostgreSQL engine/resource/configuration/topology changes, and production-scale observability.
Server-hot-path review owns the non-SQL server budget: tick CPU, broadcast fan-out and
serialization, cache seams, and retention for anything that grows (the seams in
`server/CLAUDE.md` "Hot paths"). Dispatch every role whose set of risk applies.

## Keep the gate current

When architecture changes, update the applicable reviewer and tests in the same change.
Anchor guidance on stable paths, symbols, seams, and gate names, not line counts. Add a
new specialist only when a concern is large enough to need focused judgment and is not
already protected by a deterministic test.

## Trust

Project hooks execute local shell with the user's permissions. Review changes before
trusting them. Each runtime snapshots only the hook registration at startup; the scripts
themselves are read when a hook fires, so review script edits like any other executable
change. The scripts are small, local, and non-networked; CI and the release malware
audit remain the enforcement layer.

To disable the clone's pre-push floor, use `git config --unset core.hooksPath`. Claude
Code can additionally use its local hook setting. Codex hook trust is managed with
`/hooks`.
