// The BLOCKING arrival: a teleport-sized jump (hearth, dungeon exit, rift exit,
// a dev teleport) into a zone the renderer has not built yet keeps the classic
// loading screen up while the destination and its neighbourhood stream in,
// rather than dropping the player into a void (src/game/zone_transition.ts
// classifies which entries land here).
//
// The screen is a CURTAIN, so this module treats it as one, exactly like boot:
// it raises the arrival cover for the whole chain, which puts the GPU-prep
// queue on the cover admission rule (everything the camera is arriving at, no
// boot debt and no background warmers), waits a bounded moment for the streamed
// decor the camera landed among to finish linking, and only then marks the
// reveal and lifts the screen. Without that wait the decor stayed hidden into
// the live frames after the lift and linked its programs there, which is the
// stall the curtain was there to hide in the first place.
//
// main.ts is a firewall: it owns the frame loop state (the input flag and the
// tick accumulator, restored through `onRevealed`) and nothing else here.

 * its own compile lands (there is no wall-clock reveal bound). ONLINE the wait
 * is zero (`arrivalRevealSettleMaxMs`): the character is live on the
 * authoritative server while the screen is up, so no cosmetic GPU-settle wait
 * may hold movement past the structural prepare (ui_effects_profile.ts
 * worldEntryGpuSettleCoverMs states the same rule for the entry cover); the
 * cover still puts the admission on its arrival rule for the prepare's own
 * duration, and whatever is unlinked at the lift keeps linking behind the
