// Discord Rich Presence, seen from the renderer: the zone line the player's
// Discord profile shows while they play, plus the elapsed-session clock under
// it. The shell owns the RPC socket; this module owns WHAT is published, WHEN,
// and WHETHER at all.
//
// PRIVACY FLOOR: an activity carries the zone name and the app identity, and
// nothing else. Never the character name, never account or wallet anything,
// never party composition. The published object's key set is pinned exactly by
// tests/desktop_discord_presence.test.ts, so a field added here fails there
// before it can reach a public profile.
//
// Lives in src/game so main.ts stays a firewall and so both halves stay
// directly Node-testable: a pure activity builder and a pure coalescer core
// (all time passed in), with the module-scope armed latch mirroring
// src/game/desktop_notifications.ts. The frame hook no-ops until composition
// arms it, so neither the web build nor an older shell pays anything per frame.
