/** Resolve the exact corpse content the local player can open in the loot popup.
 *
 *  Note on the harvest arm's data source, because it is the one thing here that
 *  does NOT come off the wire: `isHarvestableCorpse` answers from
 *  HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS in the client's own bundle, reached through the
 *  entity's `tid`. So a client whose content predates a change disagrees with the
 *  server about which corpses are harvestable. Both directions are safe today: a
 *  client that over-offers gets the server's pre-claim refusal and burns nothing,
 *  and a client that under-offers merely hides a picker. The second direction is
 *  the one to watch if a family is ever wired server-side without a client
 *  deploy, since a hidden picker suppresses a harvest the server would honor.
 *  #2514 adds a third direction, milder than both: the same table now also
 *  decides which picker rows are marked "nothing yet" and what concentration
 *  bonus the sim pays, so a skewed client can mark a row dead that the server
 *  pays out, or show a bonus hint the server does not agree with. Nothing is
 *  burned and the sim stays authoritative; the player just sees a stale label.
 *
 *  Answers "may I OPEN this corpse", not "does it have contents": the arms
 *  mirror the sim's authoritative corpseLootRights + lootCorpse loop
 *  (src/sim/interaction.ts) via the sim's own pure predicates, so a stranger's
 *  owner-locked kill no longer captures the interact press (and its denial
 *  toast) away from whatever sits under it.
 *  `harvestStateReliable` is true on every production path (no caller passes
 *  it: offline is sim-local truth, online
 *  mirrors harvestClaimedBy via the hcb wire key). The parameter is a
 *  deliberately retained seam for a transport that cannot mirror harvest
 *  claims; its false arm stays pinned in tests/corpse_loot_availability.test.ts
 *  and tests/interactions.test.ts (positional third argument), so do not
 *  remove it as dead plumbing without sweeping those pins.
 *  `partyMemberIds` is the LOCAL player's party roster (pids, self included;
 *  null when solo): party membership is symmetric, so it stands in for the
 *  tapper's party exactly when that grants anything (the tapper being in MY
 *  party). Offline entities carry the real tappedById / lootFfaTimer and the
 *  roster is the bot party; online both ride the wire (tap, ffa keys), so the
 *  same code serves both hosts unchanged. */
