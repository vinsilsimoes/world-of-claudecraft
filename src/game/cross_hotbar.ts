// pure-core split gamepad_map.ts uses for the stick math). The thin
// `GamepadManager` consumer in gamepad.ts owns polling and dispatch.
//
// Holding a trigger lights eight slots at once: the d-pad diamond and the face
// diamond. The left trigger reaches one eight, the right trigger the other, so
// one set is sixteen actions reachable without lifting a thumb. Tapping the
// opposite trigger while holding swaps to the second set (the "double" bar), for
// thirty-two in reach.
