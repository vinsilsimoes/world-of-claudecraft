// Thin painter for the party frames' below-target offset: measures the target
// frame, its #tf-debuffs strip, and the party frames container, feeds the pure
// calc (party_below_target_core.ts), and keeps the measured author-space bottom
// in the --party-below-target-bottom custom property on #party-frames. The
// below-target CSS rules (hud.css, hud.mobile.css) derive the frames' top from
// that property, so the frames clear the buff strip at any buff count, UI
// scale, or dragged frame position instead of relying on a hand-tuned constant.
//
// While pushing, it also writes two SENSOR properties, --party-rows-top and
// --party-rows-limit (the member rows' measured top, and the y the rows must
// end above: the move pad's top on mobile, the viewport bottom on desktop),
// from which the below-target .party-rows rules derive their max-height, so
// the pushed-down rows stop above the movement pad on mobile and never run
// off screen on desktop (long raid rosters scroll instead). The painter only
// senses; the policy arithmetic (gaps, floors) stays in the stylesheet.
//
// Hot-path discipline: update() runs every frame from Hud.updatePartyFrames,
// so the (at most five) getBoundingClientRect measures are gated behind a
// cheap invalidation key built ONLY from non-layout reads (attribute strings,
// child count, viewport size). Steady state (unchanged key, the dominant case)
// does no layout read and no DOM write; the property writes route through the
// elided setStyleProp writer. The key includes the container's own style
// attribute, which our writes change once, so a value change costs exactly one
// extra (idempotent, then elided) re-measure before the key settles.
