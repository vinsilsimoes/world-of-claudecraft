// Pure, host-agnostic view model for the vendor window.

// This is the pure-core half of the pure-core + thin-consumer split (root

// the one thing the vendor window decides that is worth testing without a DOM:
// which rows are sellable goods and which buyback slots are still redeemable,
// and at what price. The DOM/i18n side lives in vendor_window.ts; rendering is
// driven entirely off the structure returned here.
//
// DOM-free and i18n-free so tests/vendor_view.test.ts can drive it directly.
