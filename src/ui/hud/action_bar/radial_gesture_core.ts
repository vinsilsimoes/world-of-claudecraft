// Pure decision core for the touch radial gesture: what a press, a drag and a
// release MEAN. The DOM half (pointer capture, the reveal timer, measuring the
// pressed button) lives in radial_gesture_controller.ts, which owns no rules of
// its own, so
// a Vitest drives every branch here without a browser.
//
// resolveRadialDirection in radial_action_core.ts answers WHERE a drag points;
// this module answers what to do about it, which is the part that has to agree
// with the rest of the HUD (a rearrange drag owns the press, an open radial
// makes the centre the way out rather than a cast).
