// The touch gesture layer for the radial action ring: pointer capture, the
// reveal timer, and measuring the pressed button. Every RULE it applies lives in
// radial_gesture_core.ts (what a release means, whether the cancel target is the
// live choice) or radial_action_core.ts (which direction a drag points at, where
// the petals sit), so this module reads pointers and reports; it decides nothing
// on its own.
//
// The gesture: pointerdown arms, a quick tap casts the button's centre action, a
// flick past FLICK_DEADZONE_PX casts that direction, and a stationary hold of
// RADIAL_REVEAL_MS reveals the petals as a learning affordance. Casting never
// waits for the reveal, because a hold plus a swipe plus a release does not fit
// inside a global cooldown. Releasing back at the anchor with the petals open
// cancels.
//
// Three things that cost real time when they are missing:
//   - Pointer capture is MANDATORY: a flick leaves the button long before the
//     release, and without capture the pointerup is delivered elsewhere and the
//     gesture is silently lost. setPointerCapture is called inside try/catch
//     because a synthetic or already-released pointer id throws, which is
//     exactly why the window-level release backstop below exists: without it a
//     throw plus a finger that left the button strands the drag forever and
//     every ring button goes dead under a painted overlay.
//   - Drags are keyed PER POINTER ID. Combat is played with two thumbs, so a
//     second ring button pressed while the first is still held must cast too;
//     one shared drag slot dropped it. The petal overlay stays single-owner
//     (one reveal is seated around one button and two cannot coexist visually),
//     so only the FIRST press to arm may open it: the second thumb still casts,
//     it just casts without the learning affordance.
//   - The press is shared. A rearrange long-press drag and an empowered-ability
//     hold both bind the same button, so the radial asks before it acts and
//     stays silent when one of them owns the press.
//
// STICKY MODE is the tap-only path the touchTapMenus setting turns on, built to
// the shape the two strips already had: a press REVEALS the petals as a
// persistent menu of real, focusable buttons and casts nothing, a second press on
// the ring button casts its centre action, tapping a petal casts that direction,
// and a press outside dismisses. Every rule is tap_menu_core.ts's, shared with
// both strips so the three menus cannot drift. With the setting off nothing here
// runs and the gesture path above is untouched.
