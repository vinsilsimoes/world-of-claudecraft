// The char-select "Redesign" editor: a character's one-shot appearance change.
//
// Every character created inside the free window (plus, as a safety net, any
// character with no authored look at all) carries a single server-tracked
// redesign token, so the target may well arrive with a look AND a helm
// preference it already chose, which is why both seed from the row. The editor
// reuses the creation customizer, docked where the news panel sits, and drives
// the shared 3D stage with a DRAFT look; nothing is written anywhere until Save
// posts it and the server burns the token atomically. Cancel (or navigating
// away, or a roster refresh) discards the draft and the character keeps the
// design it had.
//
// Its own module rather than more top-level functions in the app coordinator:
// this is a self-contained screen, it needs none of the coordinator's private
// mutable state, and everything it does need arrives through RedesignEditorDeps.
// That also makes the two decisions worth testing (what the stage is driven
// with, and when the token is actually spent) reachable from a Vitest with a
// fake host instead of only by clicking.
