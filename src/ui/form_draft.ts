// Preserve what a player has TYPED across a forced window rebuild.
//
// The `woc:languagechange` fan-out (Hud.refreshLocalizedDynamicUi) forces one
// full repaint of every open window so its t() text lands in the new locale.
// Three of those windows build their text fields with innerHTML and emit them
// empty every time (the calendar's guild-event booking form, the mailbox Send
// tab, the social window's typeahead and guild billboard), so the repaint that
// fixes the language would wipe a half-written letter. Those windows capture the
// live values first, rebuild, and write them back.
//
// This is the same hazard the mailbox already ruled on for a different trigger:
// attaching a parcel used to run the full render and wiped the compose form
// (#1695), which is why stageParcel repaints only the parcels row. A language
// switch cannot narrow that way, since every label in the window is what moved.
//
// KEYED ON THE FIELD'S OWN IDENTITY, its `id` or its `data-field`, never its
// position. A rebuild in another language reorders nothing, but the social
// window's footer markup differs per tab, and an index-keyed restore would put a
// half-typed guild name into the friend field the moment a tab was involved. A
// field carrying neither key is skipped rather than guessed at.
//
// THE FOCUS HALF GOES THROUGH ./focus_restore.ts, the seam #2528 extracted for
// carrying focus across a rebuild: `focusedWithin` owns the activeElement
// narrowing and the containment check, and `restoreFirstEnabled` owns the
// disabled skip (a control the rebuild came back DISABLED cannot take focus, and
// focusing it anyway drops the player to <body> in exactly the case the idiom
// exists for). What stays here is the identity, because this module needs one key
// that finds the element again to write a captured VALUE back, which
// `data-focus-key` does not provide.
//
// FOCUS IS RESTORED ONLY IF IT WAS ALREADY INSIDE THIS ROOT. The language picker
// lives in the Options window, so at the moment of a switch the player is
// normally focused there; re-focusing a mailbox field would yank the caret out
// from under them. Capturing it is still worth it because the two windows CAN
// both be open (opening a window no longer closes its siblings), and focus is
// tracked for ANY control under the root, not only the text fields: these
// windows install a Tab trap that only arms while `root.contains(activeElement)`
// (see focus_manager.ts), so a rebuild that dropped focus to `<body>` would let
// the next Tab walk straight out of the window. The spellbook already restores
// focus by selector across its own rebuild for the same reason.
