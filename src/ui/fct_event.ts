// source/target priority, the ability vs auto split, the miss/dodge self-vs-other colour
// flag) into one deterministic, testable function. Host-agnostic and DOM/clock/i18n-free
// (registered in UI_PURE_CORES): the localized text (the t() calls and the `${amount}` /
// `-${amount}` / `+${amount}` fragments) and the resolved target entity STAY at the call
// site and are spread onto this result, so the core never calls t() or reads an entity,
// consistent with fct_core emitting discriminators and the painter localizing.
