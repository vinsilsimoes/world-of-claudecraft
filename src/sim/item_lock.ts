// Player-controlled per-item lock (issue 3042): an item the owner has locked
// refuses salvage, profession-craft reagent consumption, and vendor sell
// (single and bulk) until unlocked again. An optional safety mark the player
// toggles themself, distinct from the def-level noVendorSell/noDiscard
// content flags (items.ts) and the per-copy transfer lock the anonymous
// exchange pipes enforce (item_instance_transfer.ts isTransferLockedInstance,
// keyed on boundTo/bindOnTrade): those are content/trade rules nobody
// chooses, this is nothing but the owner's own choice, so it lives on the
// SAME optional ItemInstancePayload every other per-copy fact rides (types.ts),
// which is what carries it through save/load and the online wire for free.
//
// Behind the SimContext seam (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): a new self-contained
// system, its own sibling module, no state of its own beyond the payload
// field.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/render/ui/game/net imports, no rng, no clock
// (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). Draws no rng.

 *  item_copy_ref.ts documents (rift forge/enchant apply): resolve the named
 *  slot WITHOUT consuming, refuse before anything mutates. Always requires a
 *  `slotIndex` (an id-only call is ambiguous the moment two copies of one
 *  item exist, and every caller here is a bag cell the player clicked, which
 *  always knows its own index).
 *
 *  Toggling the lock never changes `count` or the slot count, so it needs no
 *  bag-space check either way: a locked payload is never mergeable
 *  (item_instance_merge.ts isMergeableInstancePayload), which simply keeps a
 *  freshly picked-up unlocked unit of the same item from silently merging
 *  into (and inheriting the lock of) an already-locked stack; it starts its
 *  own separate slot instead, same as any other non-mergeable payload. */
