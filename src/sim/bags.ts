// Bags: the WoW-style inventory capacity system. The player carries a fixed
// 16-slot backpack plus up to 4 equippable bag items (kind:'bag', each granting
// `bagSlots` extra slots). Capacity is POOLED: items live in the one flat
// PlayerMeta.inventory list and the equipped bags only raise the slot budget,
// so nothing here pins an item to a specific container (the wire shape and the
// JSONB save shape are unchanged).
//
// This module follows the items.ts pattern: pure capacity/stacking math a
// Vitest imports directly, plus the two command bodies (equipBag/unequipBag)
// as free functions `fn(ctx, ...)` behind SimContext. Backing state stays on
// Sim (PlayerMeta.bags); Sim keeps thin same-named delegates.
//
// Capacity is enforced at the command boundaries (buy, loot, pick up, fish,
// conjure, market collect, trade accept, quest turn-in, unequip, and the
// profession transforms: craft, salvage, disenchant, enchant apply, and the
// unbind stack split, #2350) via canAddItem/fitsAll/countFit pre-checks; a
// transform command models the post-consumption inventory on a scratch copy
// (removeStacked/consumeOneScratch below) so consuming the inputs can free
// the room the output needs. Grant paths a player cannot re-try (winning a
// need/greed roll, master loot, delve end-of-run rewards, dev gives) skip the
// check on purpose: an over-capacity inventory is tolerated (pre-bag saves may
// load overflowing too) and simply blocks new pickups until space is freed.
// Items are never destroyed by capacity.
//
// `src/sim`-pure: no DOM/Three/render-ui-game-net imports, no Math.random/
// Date.now (enforced by tests/architecture.test.ts). This module draws NO rng.
