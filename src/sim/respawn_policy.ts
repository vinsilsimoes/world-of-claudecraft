// Open-world mob respawn policy: how long a slain mob stays down.
//
// A pure leaf (no SimContext, no state): a Vitest imports it directly, and the
// one live caller is the death site in combat/damage.ts.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: this is a deliberate content-tuning knob, not a classic-era
// formula. It is stated once here and pinned by tests/respawn_policy.test.ts,
// with the downstream farm ceilings pinned by tests/economy_yield.test.ts.
//
// HISTORY, because this number has now moved twice and the reasoning matters:
//
//  1. The world shipped for months on one flat 25s timer for every open-world
//     mob.
//  2. That was replaced by three respawn tiers keyed to a zone's level band (60
//     / 120 / 180s), on the argument that a farmed camp regenerating three times
//     a minute paid gold and XP past what the zone was tuned for.
//  3. The tiers are now retired, back to a single 60s delay. Measuring the tiers
//     against how players actually farm did not support them:
//
//     - Respawn was never the binding constraint for a solo player. Even at
//       180s the densest route in the world (Thornpeak's Glimmermere corridor,
//       63 standing mobs) supported about 20 kills a minute, and a player who
//       kills one mob every 8 seconds wants 7. Nobody was ever waiting on a
//       spawn. The tiers only ever throttled AoE multi-pulls and several players
//       sharing a route.
//     - The per-hour ceilings that justified the tiers assume a farmer who
//       kills every mob the instant it respawns with zero travel: at the top
//       cluster that is 1.01 kills per SECOND, sustained, across 130 yards. It
//       is a bound, not a forecast, and the tiers were sized against a pace no
//       player can reach.
//     - The one genuine outlier turned out to be a single mob rather than a
//       tier: Warlord Drogmar is boss: true with boss-tier loot but declared no
//       cadence, so he inherited the trash timer and was 24% of that corridor's
//       gold by himself. He now carries an explicit respawnMult (zone3.ts).
//
// The thinner zones are what motivated the revisit: the ten expansion zones
// share the old endgame band but not its density (their largest cluster is
// Galecrest's 14-mob shipwreck against Glimmermere's 63), so 180s there bought
// no farm resistance and only made thin country feel empty.
//
// ZoneDef.trashRespawnSeconds remains the per-zone escape hatch. If a specific
// zone ever needs its own cadence, set it there rather than reintroducing bands.

 * An explicit SimConfig base still overrides everything below the template's own
 * fixed seconds, for both populations, exactly as it always did.
