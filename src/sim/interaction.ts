/**
 * Profession harvest: single-use, first-come salvage of a dead mob's corpse

 * command reaches here first while the corpse is unclaimed wins; every later
 * attempt against the same corpse (same tick or later) is denied. See
 * professions/gathering.ts for the race-freedom argument.
 *
 * `components` (#1142) is the player's per-corpse focus pick: which tagged
 * component(s) to extract. OMITTED (undefined) resolves to the
 * player's persistent town focus: the corpse tags holding allocation points
 * (none focused falls through to the spread). An EXPLICIT array keeps the
 * #1142 semantics: empty or covering every tagged component spreads across
 * every tag (the #1141 behavior); extracting fewer concentrates the effort for
 * a higher tier per component, per resolveCorpseFocusHarvest in
 * professions/gathering.ts. Extracting, not picking: an unmapped family is
 * never extracted, so on a corpse carrying one mapped family there is no
 * choice to make (#2514, see below). That array is sanitized before any of it is read
 * (effectiveFocusComponents): repeats collapse (#2474) and tags this corpse
 * does not carry drop out (#2504), so `['hide','hide']` and `['hide','junk']`
 * are both exactly `['hide']` here and in the pre-claim capacity gate below,
 * and a pick of nothing but junk is exactly the empty pick (it spreads).
 * A pick that survives sanitization but names only families with no item
 * behind them is REFUSED pre-claim instead (#2509, see the gate below), so no
 * selection can spend a single-use corpse for nothing. A pick that names such
 * a family BESIDE one that pays is allowed, and the unmapped entry is simply
 * not extracted (#2514, yieldingFocusComponents): it costs no tier roll, no
 * rng draw, and no concentration tier, so `['hide','claw']` is byte-identical
 * to `['hide']`.
 *
 * The corpse-level half of that rule is isHarvestableCorpse (#2513): it answers
 * on the MAPPED families the template carries, so a corpse that could never pay
 * anything is refused up front (error.corpseNothingToHarvest) instead of
 * advertising a harvest, taking the command, spending the claim and reporting
 * nothing. Between the two gates, every command that reaches the roll below
 * yields at least one item, so no path through this function can spend a
 * single-use claim in silence.

  // Placed with the capacity gate below, for the same three reasons that one
  // is here: pre-claim (a refusal must leave the corpse for the next
  // harvester), rng-free (a refused command must not shift the world's draw
  // order), and derived from the same sanitized pick the roll is. It fires

  // and one as the `.filter` inside yieldingFocusComponents), and
  // the bags-full gate needs `wanted` non-empty, so neither can mask the
  // other's message. The predicate itself lives beside effectiveFocusComponents
  // (professions/gathering.ts) because the picker's view-core mirrors it; one
  // rule, one place, or the two drift the first time the spread rule moves.
  //
  // Deliberately NOT narrowed inside effectiveFocusComponents the way an
  // uncarried tag is (#2504), and that ordering is still load-bearing after
  // #2514 moved the bonus: the refusal is a statement about the pick the player
  // MADE, so it has to be asked before the unmapped families are dropped. Fold
  // the drop into effectiveFocusComponents instead and ['claw'] sanitizes to
  // the empty pick, spreads, and burns the corpse in the silence this refusal
  // exists to end. The drop happens one step later, in
  // yieldingFocusComponents, which is what the capacity gate below and the tier
  // rolls read.
  //
  // Scope, the other half of the #2504 comment: that one covers a tag the
  // corpse does not CARRY, which sanitizes away and spreads. This covers a tag
  // it carries that HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS does not map (gills, horn) on a
  // corpse that ALSO carries a mapped one. A corpse whose tags ALL map to
  // nothing never reaches this gate at all any more (#2513): the
  // isHarvestableCorpse check above answers on mapped families, so such a
  // corpse is refused there with error.corpseNothingToHarvest, exactly like
  // the 101 shipped templates that carry no component tags. (fen_troll (claw,
  // tusk) was the shipped example until #2905 mapped both; the all-unmapped
  // state now lives only in retagged test fixtures.) That closed
  // the last path to a claim spent in silence, and it is why this predicate's
  // second half (`taggedComponents.some(yields)`) is now belt and braces here
  // rather than the term that kept an all-unmapped corpse claimable.
  //
  // This also covers the DERIVED pick, not just an explicit one: an omitted
  // `components` resolves through meta.townFocus, so a persisted `{ claw: 5 }`
  // makes the plain interact press take this arm too. Refusing is the better
  // outcome there as well: the corpse survives for a pick that can pay out,
  // instead of being burned by a focus the player cannot see. #2511 has since
  // closed the route that could WRITE such a focus (set_town_focus rejects a
  // key outside HARVEST_COMPONENT_ITEMS, and the load arm drops one an older
  // save carries), so this arm is now defense in depth on the derived pick

  // the whole rolled quantity for a signed component (#2473). Without room for
  // all of it the signed-family grant falls back to the
  // plain fungible top-up (the signature truncates, the yield does not) while
  // a specimen truncates outright, the same truncation contract harvestNode's
  // signed grants follow. Each downgrade tells the player via the text-free
  // personal gatherDowngrade event, at most ONCE per harvest command (the
  // toolDeniedEmitted idiom); the mark-lost arm runs first, so when both a
  // signature and a jackpot are lost the single event reports the mark.
  // All-or-nothing is a deliberate divergence from harvestNode, whose signed
  // batch lands a PARTIAL fit and lets the rest of the yield go: a corpse
  // downgrade is an UNCAPPED plain grant of the whole rolled quantity into
  // pre-gate-reserved room, so refusing the signature here costs the player no
  // units and keeps the harvest at one ledger entry (one chat line) per item.
  //
  // #2473, the one behavior this quantity fix trades away, deliberately: with
  // PARTIAL same-signer merge room the counted grant spills into a fresh slot
  // where the one-unit grant it replaces merged for free, so on a corpse that
  // also procs a specimen (forest_wolf tags hide AND fang) the last free slot
  // can go to the component instead of the jackpot, which then truncates with
  // its lost: 'find' notice. The component wins that slot for one reason only,
  // stated plainly because it is easy to get wrong: this loop runs FIRST. It is
  // NOT holding a claim on the slot. The pre-gate reserves room for a PLAIN add
  // (every `wanted` entry carries no instance) and a signed instance can never
  // spend plain-stack room (#1165), so the free slot taken here is unreserved
  // room, the same unreserved room the specimen wanted.
  // Refusing the signature whenever a jackpot is pending was measured across
  // corpse templates, bag shapes, seeds and focus picks: it saves the specimen
  // in every case that truncates and costs no yield, but it refuses tens of
  // signatures for each specimen saved, because most bags have plain-stack room
  // the fallback would have used anyway. Paying that much for a rare extra is
  // the worse trade, so the simple rule stands. BOTH states are pinned in
  // tests/corpse_harvest_sim.test.ts: the one where holding back would change
  // nothing, and the one where it would have saved the jackpot. The real cure
  // is a specimen reservation in the pre-gate, wider than this issue.
