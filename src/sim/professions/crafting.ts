// Common-tier crafting resolution (issue #1127). Behind the SimContext seam:
// checks a player has every reagent a recipe requires, consumes them (denying
// and consuming NOTHING if any reagent is short), grants the recipe's declared
// output deterministically (Professions 2.0 retired the output quality
// roll: the only output-side rng is the single masterwork proc draw below, at
// the same draw position the old roll occupied), and grants a flat point of
// craft skill (see wheel.ts: additive-only, free-floor). A proc mints a
// masterwork instance whose bonus stats are baked from the item budget
// (professions/masterwork.ts): add-only, never a downgrade. Input-side rng
// (gathering.ts rollMaterialRarity) is untouched by the deterministic-output model.
//
// Scope: originally the common-tier path only; the module now also resolves
// the higher-tier content that landed on it (content/recipes.ts TOOL_RECIPES
// at skillReq 75/150, COMBO_RECIPES at skillReq 25), the #1132 combo gate,
// the #1129 archetype empowerment ceiling, the #1299 acquisition gate, and
// the #1301 gold sink + output throttle. There is still NO skillReq
// admission gate: any known recipe is attemptable on materials alone, and
// tier only shapes skill-gain scaling, the masterwork proc chance, and (via
// the ceiling) masterwork eligibility.
//
// #1149 (Battlefield Experience) attribution: a crafted output whose DEF
// quality is rare-or-better is stamped with its crafter's name via
// ctx.addItemInstance (the signing threshold reads the static
// def quality, since outputs no longer roll one), same signable-rarity
// threshold and same {signer} shape gathering.ts's harvestCorpse already uses
// for monster materials (#1145). Below that threshold the output stays a
// plain fungible grant. A masterwork proc's copy is always instanced and
// signed, whatever its def quality. This is what gives
// professions/battlefield_xp.ts a `signer` to resolve later, when that
// specific copy is drunk/worn/lands a killing blow.
//
// Specialization material discount (#1134): once a player is specialized in a
// recipe's craft (wheel.ts `isSpecialized`, gated on `PERK_THRESHOLDS`
// content), every reagent's required quantity is discounted via
// `materialCostMultiplier`, floored, with a minimum of 1 (a discount can never
// make a recipe free of an ingredient it needs at least one of). This is
// applied identically to the availability check and the actual consumption,
// so a specialized crafter is never asked for more than they are charged.
//
// #1145 self-gathered crafting bonus: the chosen bonus is a REDUCED REQUIRED
// QUANTITY (rather than an item-level/quality lift): one fewer unit of a
// reagent per craft, for every reagent where the crafter holds at least one
// signed instance stamped with their OWN name (a rare+ monster material they
// harvested themselves; see professions/gathering.ts). Using someone ELSE's
// signed material (signer set but not the crafter's own name) is NOT counted
// here: it behaves exactly like a plain unsigned material, no bonus.
//
// The two discounts COMPOSE: the #1145 flat reduction is applied to the
// listed reagent count first (floored at 1), then the #1134 specialization
// percentage multiplier is applied to that result (floored at 1), so a
// specialized crafter using their own self-signed material gets both
// benefits and neither discount can ever waive a reagent entirely.
//
// The masterwork proc's signed-reagent term (masterwork.ts) is DELIBERATELY
// wider than #1145 (the 2026-07-17 design ruling): it counts a held signed
// instance with ANY player's signature, the crafter's own included, so buying
// a gatherer's signed materials is worth as much to the proc as gathering
// your own. It is also decoupled from the quantity discount: a count-1 signed
// reagent feeds the proc even though the discount can never fire for it. Only
// the quantity discount stays self-only.
//
// Combo-recipe requirement (issue #1132): a recipe may carry a
// `comboRequirement` naming one specific adjacent craft pair and a minimum
// tier both must meet. The character must be attuned to that exact unordered
// pair, and both named crafts must reach the required archetype-gated tier.
//
// This module is `src/sim`-pure (see src/sim/CLAUDE.md): no DOM/render/ui/
// game/net imports, no Math.random/Date.now, host-agnostic so it runs
// offline, on the server, and in the headless RL env unchanged.
