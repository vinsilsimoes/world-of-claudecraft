// Enchanting profession: disenchant an eligible weapon/armor piece into arcane
// materials, then spend those materials to apply a permanent stat bonus to a
// SPECIFIC copy of an item (not the character, not the item id in the
// abstract): a bagged copy, or, with a slot named, the copy WORN in that
// equipment slot, enchanted in place. An enchanted piece is a non-stacking
// instanced copy
// (types.ts ItemInstancePayload.rolled.stats), so it survives equip/unequip
// (src/sim/items.ts) and stays a distinct good, separate from a plain copy of
// the same item id. sellItem/discardItem/trade's drop arm now prefer a
// fungible copy over this one (items.ts removePreferFungible), and trade,
// the World Market, and Ravenpost mail all carry the payload end to end
// (#2049, then #2507 completed the anonymous pipes via
// src/sim/item_instance_transfer.ts).
//
// Replacing an enchant (#2415): an already-enchanted copy is never silently
// overwritten, but it is not locked forever either. The apply command carries
// an explicit confirmReplace flag; with it set, the one-step replace arm
// destroys the old enchant outright (no material refund: disenchanting is the
// material faucet and enchanting the sink) and applies the new one
// surgically: only the enchant layer changes, the signer, masterwork stats,
// and boundTo/bindOnTrade flags carry through byte-identical
// (replacedEnchantPayloadFor below). Without the flag the deny is the
// dedicated already_enchanted reason, on both the bagged and the worn arm.
// WITH the flag, re-applying the identical enchant id denies as same_enchant
// on both arms, because its accept would be pure reagent loss with zero state
// change. The order matters and is deliberate: the flag check precedes the id
// compare, so an unconfirmed same-id apply reads already_enchanted, not
// same_enchant. Replacement is just an apply: same shared action throttle, no
// extra fee or skill gate.
//
// Layered on top of, not a replacement for, the existing everyone-can-salvage
// system (./salvage.ts, issue #1300): salvage still yields the same generic
// materials (bone_fragments/linen_scrap/spider_leg) for anyone, unconditionally.
// disenchantItem here is the Enchanting-specific action: dedicated arcane
// materials, scaling with the item's rarity (strictly better than plain
// salvage from `rare` up; near-identical vendor value at `common`), and is
// the intended reagent source for applyEnchant below.
//
// Scope (v1): no skill-gate beyond the free-floor rule every other common-tier
// craft action in this repo follows (crafting.ts, wheel.ts) - any player can
// disenchant or apply an enchant regardless of craftSkills.enchanting. Both
// actions DO gain flat 'enchanting' skill on success now (#1712 round-3
// review point 3), so the specialization recharge discount (professions/
// tools.ts) and the Enchanter archetype eventually engage; the archetype
// output-quality ceiling crafting.ts's craftItem enforces is NOT wired in
// here yet (this action has no rollable output quality to clamp), matching
// how salvage.ts also does not participate in that half of the wheel. Wired
// through the full stack in Professions 2.0: the disenchant_item /
// apply_enchant WS commands, the IWorldProfessions + ClientWorld
// disenchantItem / applyEnchant members, and the src/ui bag-item action menu
// plus Apply Enchant picker (bag_item_action_menu.ts), the way craft_item /
// harvest_node already are.
//

 *
 *  Marker copies (victim.enchant set): the old bonus is SUBTRACTED per stat,

 *  (content/enchants.ts), and a key that reaches zero is DELETED rather than
 *  kept at 0: item_instance_merge.ts's structural equality treats a present

 *  replaced copy comparing equal to a fresh same-enchant peer. The <= 0 arm
 *  also swallows a corrupt over-large baked value gracefully instead of
 *  minting a negative stat.
 *
 *  One accepted asymmetry in that prune: a masterwork bake can itself contain
 *  a ZERO-valued key (item_budget.ts normalizePrimaryStats writes out[k] =
 *  base, and base floors to 0 when the exact share rounds down and the
 *  leftover pass does not reach that axis). Bake {str:1, agi:0} plus an
 *  agility enchant is {str:1, agi:2}; replacing it with a strength enchant
 *  subtracts agi to 0 and PRUNES the key, giving {str:3}, while a fresh peer
 *  off the same bake keeps {str:3, agi:0}. Stat-identical (a zero contributes
 *  nothing to recalcPlayerStats), but structurallyEqual counts present-0 as
 *  distinct from absent, so those two copies would not stack. Accepted: gear
 *  is stack-cap 1, so no stack exists to lose, and preserving the zero would
 *  cost the far more common zero-residue case its clean peer equality.
 *  Legacy pre-marker copies (bare rolled.stats, no
 *  masterwork): rolled.stats is replaced WHOLESALE, exact because applyEnchant
 *  was the only writer of rolled.stats before the masterwork model, so on
 *  such a copy the whole map IS the old enchant. Standing caution: that
 *  sole-writer premise is what keeps the wipe safe, so any future system that
 *  writes rolled.stats WITHOUT setting rolled.masterwork would hand its stats
 *  to this arm for deletion (and to isEnchantedInstance for misclassification)
 *  and must use the masterwork flag or a new marker instead.
 *
 *  Callers must resolve and validate the old enchant id BEFORE calling (the
 *  same_enchant deny, and the defensive unknown-old-id deny): this function

 *  holds no eligible copy, or any reagent is short (all-or-nothing, same
 *  reagent-availability discipline crafting.ts's craftItem uses).

 *  and every reagent, then grants a freshly-instanced copy carrying the
 *  enchant's stat bonus (ctx.addItemInstance): equipping THAT copy is what

 *  Without it, an enchanted-only target denies with the dedicated
 *  already_enchanted reason, never a silent overwrite. The flag is inert when
 *  an unenchanted eligible copy exists and no enchanted one does: consent to
 *  destroy is meaningless when nothing would be destroyed, so the plain arm
 *  proceeds (this also keeps a confirmed command race-safe when the enchanted
 *  copy left the bags between dialog and accept: it falls back to a deny or a
 *  destroy-nothing apply, never a surprise overwrite of a different copy).
 *  The converse is NOT symmetric and is deliberate: when BOTH an enchanted and
 *  an unenchanted copy of the item id are held, the flag still routes to the
 *  replace arm, so a confirmed command destroys the enchant rather than
 *  quietly spending the free copy. The player asked for this specific copy in
 *  the picker (the replace row is the only sender of the flag), and silently
 *  redirecting a confirmed destroy onto a different copy would be the bigger
