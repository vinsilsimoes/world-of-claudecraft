// owners can rebalance and redesign each spec without deleting the hotfix floor.

// Paladin, Warrior, and Mage are deliberately excluded. Paladin now owns a
// complete class-specific kit and mastery layer, so retaining its legacy floor
// would double-apply specialization power. Warrior and Mage remain excluded for
// the original hotfix balance reasons. Mage also has no Chronomancy baseline
// (new healer kit, no former baseline to restore).
