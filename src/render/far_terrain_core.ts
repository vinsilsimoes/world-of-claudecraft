// Pure planning core for the far-vista terrain layer: the whole-world coarse
// mesh that stands in for everything past the detail envelope, so the horizon
// shows real terrain. The outdoor fog is gone on the vista tiers; this layer
// is what makes that possible, because without it the detail envelope's edge
// would face open void.
//
// The layer splits the one distance the renderer used to key off fog into:
// - detail far: what the existing subsystems (terrain chunks, props, town,
//   foliage, water, zone streaming) cull against. Capped at the classic
//   MAX_OUTDOOR_FOG_FAR envelope so their cost model is unchanged.
// - view far: the tier's whole-world envelope (the camera far plane rides
//   it). The far mesh, and the foliage sprites, fill the band between.
//
// Everything here is host-agnostic math (no Three, no DOM) so a Vitest
// drives every decision directly; the thin painter is far_terrain.ts. The
// color recipe is a cheap re-read of the near terrain's vertex thresholds
// (terrain_chunk_build.ts) against the shared terrain_palette.ts data: one
// terrainHeight tap per vertex (slope and normals come from the sampled
// grid), which is what makes a whole-world pass affordable.

 * This is the whole fix for the faceted mountainside. The near terrain sizes
 * its ramps against its OWN step: the 26 unit snow ramp in
 * terrain_chunk_build.ts is deliberately wide because that heightfield
 * terraces 6 units at a time, and a ramp comparable to the step paints
 * alternate treads fully white and fully bare. The far mesh re-reads those

 * resolves inside a single cell: one vertex takes full pale snow while its
 * neighbour takes bare rock, and interpolated across the two triangles they
 * share, that is the pale-against-black sawtooth a coarse mountainside shows
 * at range. The slope ramp aliases the same way and for the same reason (a
 * two-cell central difference on a cliff scatters by more than the 0.5 the
 * rock threshold spans), which is what streaked the snowbound realms with
 * dark rock facets.
 *
 * Widening about the ramp's MIDPOINT is what keeps this honest. A vertex on
 * ground the mesh CAN resolve has no per-cell change and keeps the shipped
 * colour exactly; ground it cannot resolve spreads the same transition over
 * the cells it needs, without moving the snow line or the rock line up or

 * stands in for. It is a stand-in, and the moment it sits higher anywhere the
 * two coexist it wins the depth test and surfaces THROUGH the detailed terrain:
 * a smooth, untextured, unshadowed skin over a real hillside, in a shape that
 * does not match it. That is what four rounds of "the distant terrain looks
 * smoothed, and it un-smooths when I walk closer" all were.
 *
 * This USED to be the MAX of the point and its four half-cell neighbours, on the
 * argument that a point sample shaves ridge crests by their chord error and a
 * shaved crest lets a tree that should be hidden behind it poke into the sky.
 * That had the priorities backwards. The shaving only shows where this layer IS
 * the terrain, past the detail envelope, and out there the trees are impostor
 * sprites whose own shortfall bilinears over THIS function
 * (foliage_impostor.ts), so they sink with the crest and keep their occlusion.
 * The overlap failure lands in the middle of the frame at gameplay range. A
 * silhouette a few units shy of true, kilometres away, is a rounding error; a
 * coarse skin surfacing through the mountain you are looking at is the bug.
 *
 * A MIN over the neighbourhood would guarantee the invariant even harder, and
 * was tried: it creases the sampled field into a V at every ridge line, and
 * those creases double the height step between neighbouring vertices, which the
 * colour recipe reads as a threshold crossing and paints as a hard band (caught
 * by the adjacent-vertex colour pin in tests/far_terrain_core). A point sample
 * keeps the field as smooth as the terrain is, puts every vertex exactly on the
 * surface, and leaves only the departure of the flat triangles BETWEEN those
 * samples, which far_surface_core.ts measures per cell and subtracts from the
 * position at build time.
