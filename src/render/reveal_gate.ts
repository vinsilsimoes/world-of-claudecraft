// Host adapter over reveal_gate_core: wires a cull's first-reveal hold to the
// renderer's live compile gate. One gate instance per consumer (the props
// view, each town's static cull), each with its own roots provider and key
// namespace (the props gate serves two disjoint ones: the far-cell grid keys
// and the `cull:` band keys). The compile itself rides the caller-supplied host, so
// this module owns only the settle plumbing, and its contract is absolute:
// every requested key MUST settle, whatever the compiles do, or scenery
// stays hidden forever. Three independent escapes guarantee it: per-root
// rejections and synchronous throws are absorbed (this runs inside a
// per-frame cull consult, so nothing may escape), and a cancelable watchdog
// covers a link that never resolves (compile-gate timeouts are
// diagnostic-only and cannot resolve early; see compile_gate.ts). The timer
// is cleared on the winning path so a settled key leaves nothing pending,
// and a watchdog reveal says so on the dev channel and records a
// machine-readable gpu-prep event (the gated_scene_attach shape).
//
// Each root is reported to the core as its own compile lands, so a consumer
// with independently revealable roots (a town: every static batch plus every
// building group) can show them one at a time instead of paying the whole
// key's first draw in the frame the last link settles.
//
// Between the two there is a SOFT deadline, derived from the learned cost of
// a reveal compile when the host offers one. It is a report, never an escape:
// past it the gate records how much of the key linked and keeps waiting, so
// the only thing that ever reveals an unlinked root early is still the hard
// watchdog. That distinction is the whole point: revealing early is exactly
// the stall the gate exists to prevent, and what a capture was missing was
// not another escape but the evidence that a key was slow.
//
// There is NO wall-clock reveal bound: a held root shows when its own compile
// lands and otherwise stays hidden, so this module owns exactly one clock, the
// watchdog's. What an IMMINENT consult buys instead is queue position: the
// request carries the flag down to the compile host, which submits that key's
// link, upload and touch pieces at the imminent priority so the decor the
// camera stands in is what the driver links first. Every gate joins the
// arrival-cover registry on creation, so a teleport's loading screen can wait
// on exactly those holds before it lifts.
