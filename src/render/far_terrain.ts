// fog removed this layer IS the draw distance: every ridge to the world
// rim renders from anywhere. All decisions live in far_terrain_core.ts
// (pure, Node-tested); this file only owns the Three objects and the
// cooperative build loop.
//
// Cost model: the tiles are static world-space geometry built once per
// session (well under a second of terrainHeight sampling, spread across
// bounded time-budgeted slices, nearest tiles first; the entry curtain
// accelerates the whole grid so the vista stands before the first visible
// frame, see accelerateInitialBuild). Per frame the layer costs one visibility
// loop over ~12 tiles plus the draw of whatever survives the frustum and
// the view envelope. Fragments inside the detail envelope are discarded
// in the shader; that overlap band is where the real terrain owns every
// pixel.

 * keeps terrain shape and body silhouettes readable underfoot. Out on the
 * vista the same floor lands on large high-albedo faces (snow caps, pale rim
 * rock) which are almost entirely ambient-lit, so they held roughly two thirds
 * of their DAY brightness against a sky graded down to a deep navy: distant
 * peaks read as glowing cutouts pasted over the night, the single loudest
 * "the far terrain ignores the day/night cycle" tell.
 *
 * A flat albedo multiply is the right shape for the fix: every light term
 * except the emissive floor multiplies albedo, so sun, hemisphere and IBL all
 * come down together and the surface keeps its light-and-shade RATIO (dimming
 * the ambient alone would flatten the shading it exists to preserve). The
 * night floor is applied after this and is albedo-shaped, so it scales with it
 * and keeps its relative say against the lit terms.
 *
 * DERIVED from NIGHT_AMBIENT_FLOOR, not a free constant. The far faces are lit
 * by that same ambient floor, so a dim tuned to one floor makes the vista glow
 * the moment the floor is raised, which is exactly what the moon-lit night
 * overhaul did (the deep-night ambient went 0.30 -> ~0.49). What must stay put
 * is the far face's ABSOLUTE night brightness (floor times dim); pin that at the
 * level the original 0.5-at-0.30 tuning gave (0.15) and solve for the dim, so
 * the vista reads the same against the navy sky at any ambient floor.
 * tests/far_terrain_night pins that PRODUCT, not the dim.
