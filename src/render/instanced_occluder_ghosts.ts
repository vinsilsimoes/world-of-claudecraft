// Ghost stand-ins that let one instance of an InstancedMesh fade while it
// occludes the chase camera (world trees, Yumi maze walls). An InstancedMesh
// cannot fade a single instance (its material is shared by every instance in
// the batch), so the occluded instance is zero-scaled and a pooled Mesh with
// a cloned transparent material renders in its place at the fade alpha.
// Ghosts parent under their source InstancedMesh: they inherit its cull
// visibility and their local matrix is the instance matrix verbatim, so
// placement is identical on the swap frame. Ghost materials clone lazily per
// source mesh and pool for reuse, so steady state allocates nothing;
// per-instance tints (leaf/bark colors) compose into the clone's color on
// acquire.
