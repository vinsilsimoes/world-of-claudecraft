// Boot-time asset preload registry. Render modules register their fetches here
// and startGame awaits assetsReady() before constructing the Renderer, so scene
// build can stay synchronous.
//
// There are TWO lanes, and the difference is only WHEN the fetch starts:
//
//   registerPreload(promise)        eager: the fetch is already running. For the
//                                  handful of assets the LAUNCHER itself draws.
//   registerDeferredPreload(thunk)  deferred: nothing runs until startGame calls
//                                  beginDeferredPreloads(), i.e. the player has
//                                  pressed Play. For world content.
//
// Why: every world module used to fetch at module import, so simply reaching the
// home screen decoded the whole asset set. The files are local to the app bundle,
// so there is no network pacing them, and the decode spike (GLB de-interleaving is
// a memory amplifier) crossed WKWebView's per-process ceiling. A 12 GB iPhone 17
// Pro was killed 1.6 s into the LAUNCHER and reloaded forever, because the entry
// crash guard only arms inside startGame and so could not even see it. That
// ceiling does not scale with device RAM, which is why bigger phones were not
// safe either.
//
// This does NOT weaken the tier-independent superset invariant that props.ts and
// characters/manifest.ts document (the v0.16.0 farmCrate P0): assetsReady() still
// awaits every CRITICAL registered task before the Renderer is constructed, so
// placement still cannot outrun a load. Only the start time moved. The ordering
// that makes that true (begin, then await) is pinned by
// tests/defer_launcher_preloads.test.ts.
