// Material.clone() copies every declarative property AND userData, but it
// silently DROPS onBeforeCompile (Material.copy simply does not list it). Both
// halves of that matter, because three keys its program cache on
// Material.customProgramCacheKey(), whose default return value IS
// `this.onBeforeCompile.toString()`:
//
//   1. a bare clone renders WITHOUT the patches its source shipped with (the
//      character rim glow, the worn surface-detail layer, the armour dye that
//      carries a player's whole outfit colorway), and
//   2. its cache key no longer matches the source's, so its first draw LINKS A
//      NEW PROGRAM instead of reusing the one the source already linked.
//
// (2) is the expensive half: cloning a rig's materials to tint them is a
// per-visual operation, so the link lands on the first frame that shows the
// effect. For the ability-VFX body glow that is the first hit on a mob rig, in
// the middle of a fight.
//
// Re-attaching the source's hooks in the source's ORDER restores both: the
// composed cache key comes out byte-identical, so three's acquireProgram
// returns the already-linked program.

/**
 * Re-attach to `clone` the onBeforeCompile layers `source` carried, in the
 * order the material factories apply them (armour dye first, then rim glow,
 * then zone haze as surfaceMat attaches it at creation, then surface detail,
 * then the vertex-colour emissive layer: each later layer chains the previous
 * hook into its own cache key). Only layers the source actually had are
 * re-attached, so a clone never gains a patch its source never carried, which
 * would break program identity just as badly.
 *
 * The dye goes FIRST because that is the order the rig factory composes them:
 * characters/assets.ts buildTintedClone re-attaches the outfit dye, then calls
 * addRimGlow, then applySurfaceDetail (the three calls sit together in its
 * GFX.standardMaterials arm). No material carries both the dye and the biome
 * haze: the dye is rig-only and the haze is world-surface-only, so no source
 * in the tree orders those two against each other.
