// The Three half of the biome haze field: one small world-space DataTexture
// plus the shared uniform block and GLSL snippet every consumer surface
// splices in, so distant land carries ITS OWN zone's atmosphere instead of
// the camera zone's. All the decisions (layout, colour sourcing, border
// cross-fade, distance ramp) live in biome_haze_field_core.ts, which is
// Node-tested; this file only owns the texture, the uniforms and the string.
//
// One field, one uniform block, four consumers. The near splat terrain, the
// far vista tiles and the water planes all splice the SAME snippet at the
// SAME point (immediately before <fog_fragment>, so the haze lands where
// scene fog lands and the horizon band still wins at the rim), and the sky
// dome samples the same field directionally for its horizon-band tint
// (sky.ts), applied before ITS fog band under the same rim rule. Sharing the
// snippet is what makes the near-to-far handoff seamless: at the detail
// horizon both surfaces evaluate identical math on identical uniforms, so
// there is no ring where one layer hands off to the other.
//
// Cost: one RGBA8 texture of about 15k texels (60 KB, one biomeAt tap per
// texel, roughly 10 ms once per session and memoized across terrain rebuilds),
// one texture fetch and a handful of ALU per world fragment, and two tiny
// uniform writes per frame.
