// Boot prewarm for the ability visuals whose materials are minted LAZILY, on
// the first cast of the session.
//
// These four modules share one idiom: a module-level `let x: XMaterials | null`
// filled by a private builder the first time the visual is constructed, which
// happens when the aura or cast goes live on an entity in view. Nothing warms
// them, so the first Frost Nova root, the first Ice Block, the first Temporal
// Hourglass and the first fireball travel form each link their programs inside
// a combat frame. The pooled ability-VFX primitives next to them do NOT have
// this problem: their engines build every material eagerly in the constructor
// (ability_vfx/), which is why the boot entry only has to SPAWN them.
//
// The stand-in is the REAL visual, one hidden instance of each (two for the
// hourglass, one per energy mode): the program a
// material links depends on the mesh wearing it (three keys `instancing` and
// the geometry's attributes into the cache key), and these visuals draw plain
// Meshes, InstancedMeshes and a Sprite. Building the live class is the only
// stand-in that provably carries all three, and it costs one shared geometry
// set and the module-cached materials, which the first cast would build anyway.
//
// The group is staged into the scene HIDDEN and never disposed: disposing a
// material releases the program this entry exists to keep, and every material
// here is the one the live cast will draw with.
