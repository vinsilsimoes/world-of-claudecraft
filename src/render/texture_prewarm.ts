// post-entry hitch metronome). Uploading each texture individually through
// WebGLRenderer.initTexture ahead of that draw, under a small per-slice time
// budget with a real yield between slices, keeps every main-thread block
// bounded; the draw that follows finds its textures resident. Already-resident
// textures make initTexture a cheap no-op, so sweeping a whole scene per step
