// Bounded intent-driven extrapolation of the LOCAL player's pose online: the
// sanctioned display-layer locomotion anticipation (src/net/CLAUDE.md).
//
// The online avatar used to wait a full round trip before moving: intent goes
// to the server, the next 20 Hz tick applies it, and the snapshot comes back.
// This module advances a display-only scratch pose every frame using the SAME
// movement math the server runs (src/sim/player_motion.ts: real speed, slope
// gates, swept static collision, jump/gravity), so starts, stops, and turns
// respond the frame the key changes.
//
// It is a visual layer with three hard safety properties, in order:
//  1. Anchored: every frame the authoritative pose (which shows the past, one
//     echo ago) is compared against where the local display WAS one echo ago
//     (a short pose-history ring); any disagreement, from server-driven motion
//     (charge, knockback) or a misprediction (a stun landing mid-press),
//     corrects as a short glide, never a divergence.
//  2. Bounded: the horizontal error from the authoritative pose is leashed to
//     what the player could legitimately cover in the latency cap; a server
//     teleport (or any gap over the renderer's 6 yd snap rule) resets outright.
//     One exception, and only one, the BLOCK EPISODE. A render frame longer
//     than a snapshot interval blocks the main thread, and the snapshots that
//     arrived meanwhile land in one burst. The browser orders that burst
//     either way, and both orderings break the display:
//       - burst applied after the frame: the anchor is frozen inside the frame
//         (alpha caps at 1), so the leash, sized for a fresh anchor, clips the
//         kernel's correct multi-step advance;
//       - burst applied before the frame's step: the anchor is fresh, but
//         ClientWorld has just re-anchored prevPos at the DRAWN pose with pos
//         several ticks ahead, so at alpha ~0 it sits behind the display by
//         more than the budget and the leash clips just the same; the display
//         then stalls while the anchor sweeps under it.
//     Neither is divergence: it is the local block seen from here, and the
//     kernel ran the same movement math the server ran. So an ISOLATED long
//     frame opens an episode where the block is trusted: the servo sits out
//     the burst sweep and the leash lends the lead the kernel took, drained
//     back afterwards. The episode is bounded (BLOCK_EPISODE_MAX_MS) and
//     isolation excludes steady low fps, where every frame is long and nothing
//     is hitching. A NETWORK gap looks the same from here but earns neither:
//     freezing the display on the leash is the right answer when nothing local
//     explains the stale anchor.
//  3. Invisible to logic: the output feeds only the renderer's
//     selfRenderPosition (mesh + camera). It never writes into ClientWorld
//     mirrored state, IWorld reads, or the input stream.
//
// Pure and Node-testable (no Three, no DOM): plain {x,y,z} in and out, like
// facing_smooth.ts / locomotion.ts. tests/self_motion.test.ts drives it
// against a real lagging Sim.
