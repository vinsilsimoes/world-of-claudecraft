// Thornhollow Fields battleground field (Thornhollow): the Three half of the render
// layer. One view per match slot, built lazily by the renderer when the player
// is near (the yumi_maze pattern).
//
// The field is an AUTHORED map, so this builder assembles rather than
// generates: the ground mesh comes from the same heightfield the sim walks on
// (battleground_terrain.ts), and every wall, tree, crate and torch is a
// catalogue GLB instanced from the generated placement record
// (battleground_placements.ts), which the SAME compiler derived the colliders
// from. What you see is what blocks you, by construction.
//
// Flags, runes and their state animation are ENTITY props (battleground_props.ts
// driven by the sim), not field geometry, so nothing here has to track match
// state; this view is static once built.
//
// Graphics fairness: nothing gameplay-actionable is tier-gated. Ground paint,
// the field's art and its point lights render on every tier; only shadow
// casting and paint texture resolution follow the tier.
