// Orchestration core for the async portrait prewarm (the paced post-entry
// lane). The host (portrait.ts) owns the WebGL rig, the shared mount, and the
// data-URL cache; this core owns the step ORDER and the lifecycle guarantees a
// Vitest can pin without a GL context:
// - the three cheap early-outs (cached, assets not ready, atlas streaming)
//   build nothing;
// - the built visual is ALWAYS released, on success, error, and every
//   mid-flight cancellation;
// - a stale host (graphics rebuild swapped the rig) stops the run before the
//   next stage, and its late encode result is never committed;
// - the cache commit happens only after a successful encode.
// The host's own contract (kept out of this core because it needs the rig):
// the visual must never stay MOUNTED across an await, because one mount is
// shared by every capture and a mounted visual would bleed into any concurrent
// one (and that one's visual into ours).
