// The bounded, reference-counted memo behind the weapon-skin emissive
// derivation (weapon_vfx.ts). Pure bookkeeping: no Three, no DOM, no clock,
// values are opaque to this core (the caller hands in derived texture pairs
// and an onEvict that owns their disposal).
//
// Why bounded: the derivation memo used to retain every (source albedo map,
// emissive spec) pair ever SEEN for the renderer's whole lifetime, about two
// full-resolution canvases plus two GPU textures per weapon cosmetic that
// ever walked past (the C2 memory ratchet). The boot prewarm now populates it
// with one entry per catalog spec, because a mapless host material took
// deriveEmissive's flat-tint fallback and linked the WRONG program twin; its
// host map is one pixel (weapon_vfx.ts weaponVfxPrewarmHostMap), so those
// entries are two 1x1 canvases each, pinned for the session by rigs that are
// deliberately never disposed. Everything above that floor still grows with
// cosmetic traffic, not with the catalog.
//
// The policy: a live rig holds a reference, and a referenced entry is NEVER
// evicted, so eviction can never change what is on screen. An entry whose
// last wearer released it stays resident (warm for the next wearer of that
// skin) until more than `maxIdle` idle entries exist; then the
// least-recently-released idle entries evict through `onEvict`. An evicted
// key simply derives again on its next acquire, byte-identically (the
// derivation is a pure function of the memo key, see
// weapon_vfx_emissive_core.ts), so eviction is invisible apart from the
// rebuild cost.
//
// Linear scans are fine at this scale: acquire/release run on rig
// build/teardown (entity stream-in/out and gear swaps), never per frame, and
// the entry count is bounded by live wearers plus the idle bound.
