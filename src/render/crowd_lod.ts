// Crowd-adaptive character LOD policy. Pure (no DOM, no Three), so the renderer
// stays a thin consumer and the thresholds are unit-testable.
//
// As the visible rig count climbs, the ranges at which a character keeps its
// articulated shadow and its full-rate animation pull in toward a floor, so more
// of the throng collapses to the single-draw far LOD + static proxy shadow, and
// the mid band samples its clips less often. Below the knee (ordinary play, a
// handful of rigs) nothing changes: the scale is exactly 1 and the cadence is 2.
//
// FPS-first: in a crowd, a far pose that freezes a little sooner (and a mid-range
// pose that refreshes every 3rd or 4th frame instead of every 2nd) is a fair trade
// for staying above 60. Both are COSMETIC. Anything a player reacts to (the local
// player, the current target, an entity mid-cast) is exempted by the caller.
//
// Past the articulated band the rig used to swap STRAIGHT to the baked idle-pose
// mesh, so a character beyond it read as a sliding statue: the pose did not slow
// down, it stopped. `characterLodBands` inserts one band between the two: the rig
// stays articulated and keeps animating at a low cadence (every 4th to 6th frame,
// so ~10 to 15 pose updates per second, the mixer integrating the skipped time so
// the clip still plays at its real speed) out to `staticRangeSq`, and only past
// that does the frozen mesh take over. The extension is the ONLY thing the far
// band adds, and it collapses to exactly 1 as the crowd grows, so a throng keeps
// today's FPS-first behaviour bit for bit.
