// Pure core for the biome haze field: the world-space lookup that lets a
// DISTANT zone carry its own atmosphere instead of borrowing the camera
// zone's.
//
// The problem it solves. On the vista tiers the outdoor fog is parked out at
// the horizon haze band (far_terrain_core.ts horizonHazePlan), so everything
// between about 150 and 2000 yards renders with no aerial perspective at all
// and with the CAMERA zone's sky and light grade over it. Looking across a
// bay from the Amberfall at the Nightbloom downs and the Palmreach canopy,
// the ground colours differ but the air does not: the frame is uniformly
// amber until you walk over the border, and then the whole world swaps at
// once. That swap is the surprise the field removes.
//
// The field itself. A low-resolution grid over the world rect (plus the far
// mesh's apron margin) where each texel holds the LOCAL zone's haze colour
// and a haze strength, both taken from that biome's outdoor fog preset. The
// grid is blurred so a zone border cross-fades over a few dozen yards rather
// than drawing a line across the vista, and the consumer shaders sample it by
// the FRAGMENT's world xz, so distant land is tinted by the air of the place
// it belongs to. The blend amount is a distance ramp from the camera
// (aerialHazeAmount): nothing at gameplay range, gentle and saturating out at
// vista range.
//
// Everything here is host-agnostic math (no Three, no DOM) so a Vitest drives
// every decision directly; the Three half (the DataTexture, the shared
// uniforms and the GLSL snippet the consumer shaders splice in) is
// biome_haze_field.ts.
