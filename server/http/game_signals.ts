// fixed sets in server/fishing_telemetry.ts, whose zone label reuses the same
// harvest band vocabulary). Nothing per-player and nothing per-GUILD (account

/**
 * The fixed nine guild-bank incident kinds. Every one of these is an abnormal
 * event on a DUPE-SENSITIVE path (the escrow save, the lease fence-out revert,
 * the reconcile, the durable-truth read, the keep-forever ledger) that
 * otherwise reports only through console.error / console.warn, i.e. it is
 * invisible to production alerting:
 * - `escrow_save_failed`: a save carrying at least one guild book FAILED, so
 *   the character half AND the book half rolled back and nothing this session
 *   did since its last save is durable. Two ways in: the db layer threw (a
 *   transport fault), or the escrow merge refused a book half and that refusal
 *   was TERMINAL (see escrow_quarantined). The live sim is ahead of durable
 *   truth until a later save or a reconcile lands.
 *   Deliberately NOT counted for a refusal that will be RETRIED: that is
 *   ordinary concurrency between two officers of one guild, it happens on a
 *   healthy realm, and folding it in here made `> 0` alerting useless. It is
 *   `escrow_refused_retry` below instead. This counter being non-zero means
 *   something actually went wrong.
 * - `escrow_refused_retry`: the escrow merge refused a book half because
 *   another session still holds unflushed work for that guild, so the save is
 *   retried once their commit makes the replay applicable (which the refusal
 *   immediately flushes for). NORMAL CONCURRENCY, not a failure: nothing was
 *   consumed, the marks and the log are exactly as they were, and the ordinary
 *   case clears in a round trip. Counted per GUILD (the unit the retry applies
 *   to), like `reconcile`. Watch its RATE, not its presence: a sustained climb
 *   means officers are contending faster than the flush resolves, and the
 *   terminal arm it precedes is `escrow_quarantined`.
 * - `save_fenced_out`: that same save matched no row (a same-account takeover
 *   rotated the character lease), so the carried books need reconciling.
 * - `escrow_quarantined`: a refusal ran out of retries, or nothing could ever
 *   make the missing value durable, so the SESSION was abandoned: quarantined
 *   (it may never persist again), reverted, and disconnected. The terminal arm
 *   of the escrow design and the one worth paging on. Counted per SESSION; the
 *   per-guild reverts it triggers count as `reconcile` below.
 * - `reconcile`: revertOwnGuildBookOps undid one guild's unflushed log, i.e. a
 *   session that can never commit again held book ops for it (a fence-out, an
 *   exhausted leave flush, a teardown, or the quarantine above). Counted per
 *   GUILD, the unit the remedy applies to.
 * - `book_unloaded`: a book was left unloaded after a failed / oversized /
 *   malformed durable read at boot. That guild's ops are inert and its disband
 *   is refused fail-closed until the process restarts, which is an
 *   operator-visible outage for that guild, not a transient.
 * - `ledger_write_failed`: a bank_ledger insert rejected, so the audit trail
 *   (scripts/bank_audit.mjs) has a hole the replay cannot see.
 * - `counterparty_orphan`: a guild bank op moved the acting character's purse
 *   or bags while the guild book did not move at all
 *   (server/guild_bank_counterparty.ts). Value crossed the purse/book boundary
 *   in ONE direction, which is the dupe signature the counterparty ledger
 *   columns exist to make visible, and no legitimate op can produce it. Paged
 *   on alongside `escrow_quarantined`: a single sample is a defect, not a
 *   transient.
 * - `counterparty_unstamped`: a guild bank_ledger row was written with NO
 *   counterparty side at all. Its NULL columns are indistinguishable from a
 *   pre-feature row, so the audit will skip that op forever: the convention
 *   that "NULL means written before the columns existed" is only a convention,
 *   and this is what makes a live write site breaking it visible instead of
 *   silent. A single sample is a defect.
 * This closed set IS the kind label's whole vocabulary; it never grows
 * per-guild or per-player (guild id is NEVER a label; the loud log line beside
 * each increment carries the identifying detail).
