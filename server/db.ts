 * The post-commit CONCURRENTLY index builds. Split out of ensureSchema and run

 * of what a slow build costs.
 *
 * These cannot run inside the schema transaction (CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
 * forbids it), and they serialize across realm processes on the session-level
 * form of the schema advisory lock so simultaneous boots cannot race an index
 * name. On a small table that is invisible. On a genuinely large one it is not:
 * a concurrent build is two heap scans plus a wait for every transaction that
 * could see the table, and while the first realm builds it EVERY OTHER REALM
 * blocks on that lock. Held before `listen`, a rolling restart paid that stall
 * on every realm at once and none of them served players while they waited.
 * Held after `listen`, a slow build delays the INDEX, not the realm.
 *
 * The trade this makes explicit: a realm can now briefly serve a reader whose
 * index does not exist yet, so a reader that depends on one of these must carry
 * its own bound rather than assume the index (see GUILD_BANK_LOG_TIMEOUT_MS).
 * Failure is loud and NOT fatal: every entry is idempotent and self-healing, so
 * the next boot retries, and a realm that is already serving should not be
 * killed by an index build.
 *
 * The dedicated client escapes the pool's timeouts entirely, and the session
 * `SET statement_timeout = 0` additionally overrides any database- or
 * role-level timeout an operator set server-side; it closes immediately after,
 * so nothing leaks to pooled connections.

 *  unspent token, and the row is only touched when every check passes. Returns
 *  whether the reroll was applied; false = not owned / outside the window with a
 *  look already / already spent, which the route maps to its error body. The appearance is already normalized by the
 *  caller (untrusted client input, hotbar_layout's contract).
 *
 *  Two ways into the WHERE arm, and the unspent token is what keeps it one-shot
 *  either way. `created_at < $6` is the PRODUCT rule: every character that
 *  existed before the cutoff gets one redesign on the house, whether or not it
 *  already carries an authored look. `appearance IS NULL` is the safety net
 *  under it, and it is why the date alone is not enough: a cutoff strands every
 *  character created after it by a client too old to post an appearance, which
 *  would then have neither a look nor any way to choose one. The OR can only
 *  ever widen eligibility, so the window stays exactly what it says.
 *
 *  The helm preference rides the SAME statement, because the redesign editor's
 *  helmet toggle is the creation toggle: a standing wardrobe choice, not a
 *  turntable view. It is sim state, so it patches the one key inside the state
 *  blob rather than rewriting it (a whole-blob write from an HTTP route would
 *  clobber a live session's progress), and follows the sim's zero-default
 *  omission convention: hidden writes the key, shown removes it, and BOTH
 *  arms are guarded on an actual change, because jsonb_set and `-` each mint a
 *  whole new datum: an unguarded write detoasts, re-serializes and re-TOASTs
 *  the entire state blob even when the value is identical, leaving dead chunks
 *  behind for autovacuum. A NULL
 *  helmHidden means the client did not offer the toggle at all and the blob is
 *  left untouched: defaulting that to false would actively UN-hide a helm the
 *  player had hidden in world. A character that has never been saved (state IS
 *  NULL) is likewise left alone; its blob is written
 *  fresh on first entry. A LIVE session still holds the old value in memory and
 *  would autosave over this, which is what the route's setHelmHiddenForCharacter
 *  push exists to prevent.
 *
 *  Unlike characterUpdateStatement, this write carries no character_leases fence.
 *  That is deliberate, not an oversight: the UPDATE only ever patches the single
 *  helmHidden key inside the state blob (never the whole thing), so a takeover
 *  racing this cannot tear it the way a full state write could, and the
 *  applyAppearanceForCharacter/setHelmHiddenForCharacter push onto the live
 *  session right after is what reconciles an online character with the row it
 *  just wrote. */
